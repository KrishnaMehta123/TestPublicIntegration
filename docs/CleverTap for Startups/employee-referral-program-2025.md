# Overview

CleverTap for Startups (C4S) is introducing an internal **Employee Referral Program** to encourage CleverTap employees to refer early-stage startups to the **CleverTap Essentials Plan**. Eligible employees can earn incentives for each qualified referral that signs up and activates post-trial.

# Eligibility Criteria

## Referrer (CleverTap Employee)

The referrer (CleverTap Employee) must meet all the following criteria:

* Must be a full-time or contractual employee of CleverTap at the time of referral and reward disbursal.
* Must submit the referral through the official [C4S Referral Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1V5mEjHdjp_-XeDcDAl72xcLqlxZFXvE_oNYvGGi95kk/viewform?edit_requested=true) to qualify. Only referrals submitted via the form will be considered valid.

## Referred Startup

The referred startup must meet all of the following criteria:

* Not be an existing CleverTap customer.
* Not be recorded in CleverTap’s internal CRM as a lead or account.
* Either have a live app or website, or be in the pre-launch stage with the capability to onboard.
* Sign up for the CleverTap Essentials Plan and complete the onboarding process.
* Remain active beyond the 30-day free trial period; a valid invoice must be generated.

# Referral Reward Structure

The reward structure for the referral is as follows:

| Referral Count | Reward Amount (USD) | Reward Amount (INR) |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1st            | $30                 | ₹2,400              |
| 2nd            | $30                 | ₹2,400              |
| 3rd            | $30                 | ₹2,400              |
| 4th            | $50 (Bonus)         | ₹4,000              |
| 5th            | $50 (Bonus)         | ₹4,000              |

The cycle resets after the 5th referral. This means the 6th referral will again earn $30 (₹2,400), just like the first referral.

# Reward Disbursal Conditions

The reward disbursal is subject to a few conditions that are as follows:

* Incentives will be processed only after:

  * The referred startup signs up for the trial,
  * Completes onboarding, and
  * Crosses the free trial period by triggering the first invoice (i.e., activation).
* Incentives are issued quarterly. Any eligible referrals within a quarter will be clubbed and disbursed in the following payment cycle.
* Rewards are delivered as Amazon or Flipkart gift cards (based on the employee’s location and preference).

# Verification and Tracking

The C4S Growth team will verify and track all referral submissions. CleverTap reserves the right to reject the referrals that:

* Do not meet the eligibility criteria,
* Are duplicate entries,
* Are already present in the CleverTap CRM,
* Do not result in activation post-trial.

# Terms and Conditions

* The program is valid until further notice and may be modified, paused, or terminated at CleverTap’s discretion.
* Rewards are non-transferable and can not be exchanged for cash.
* Any disputes regarding referral eligibility, reward qualification, or disbursement timelines will be resolved at the sole discretion of the C4S Growth team.
* Participation in this program constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions.
