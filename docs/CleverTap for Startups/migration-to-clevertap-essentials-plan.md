# Overview

In **July 2023**, CleverTap introduced a new and enhanced **Essentials Plan**. Starting July 2023, new customers were automatically enrolled on the Essentials Plan. However, the customers who signed up before July 2023 are still on the Basic Plan. CleverTap will **sunset the Basic Plan by March 31, 2024**, and the customers still on the Basic Plan will be transitioned to the Essentials Plan.

> 📘 Points to Consider
>
> Here are the key points to consider before migrating from Basic to Essentials Plan:
>
> * The Basic Plan will be  **sunset on March 31, 2024**. All customers currently on the Basic Plan will be **automatically moved to the Essentials plan starting April 1, 2024**. 
> * Monthly Active User (MAU) tier and selected add-ons will be mapped while migrating. This ensures there is no interruption to your active campaigns or journeys. However, if a feature is not part of the Essentials Plan but is used in any existing campaigns/journeys, those campaigns/journeys might stop working. In this case, our team will email you the alternatives for affected campaigns. For further queries, reach out to [CleverTap support](mailto:help@clevertap.com.). 
> * If you use an add-on that is not available in the Essentials Plan, the features associated with the add-on will no longer be accessible.

## Features and Add-Ons

The Essentials Plan offers features and add-ons important for startup businesses to maximize retention and customer lifetime value. While the majority of the features are part of the plan, a few of the features are available as additional add-ons. You must add the required add-ons from the *My Plan* page to use them.\
Check the images below to understand how the features and add-ons have been repackaged to offer better retention.

## Pricing

While the appearance of invoices will remain unchanged, the charges will now align with the Essentials Plan in the updated invoices. The total invoice may increase or decrease based on the MAU tier and selected add-ons.  If you choose the annual billing cycle, it comes with a 30% discount.

> 📘 Change in Add-Ons Pricing
>
> The add-ons are billed at 10% of your base plan, determined by your initial MAU requirements. You can find more information about the add-ons offered by CleverTap [here](https://clevertap.com/clevertap-for-startups-features/?utm_source=C4Sdoc\&utm_medium=doc\&utm_campaign=KB).

## Data Retention Policy

The **Data Retention Policy** (DRP) for the CleverTap Essentials Plan has been **upgraded to 3 years**. All customer data from one year since the migration date, Apr 1, 2023, will now be considered under the new three-year DRP.

For example, if a customer joined in April 2021. Under the **Basic Plan**, CleverTap stores one-year data with a one-year DRP. If they migrate to the Essentials Plan on February 9, 2024, DRP will extend to three years. Despite the historical norm of retaining only last year's data for this customer, the new three-year DRP now encompasses data from February 10, 2023, to February 9, 2024, onwards. This data will be preserved until February 9, 2026, reflecting the adjustment to the three-year DRP.

For more information on the DRP, refer to [Data Management](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/account-and-data-management#data-management).  

# FAQs

Read the following FAQs to find quick and comprehensive answers to common queries related to the migration.

### Q. Who is affected by this change?

A. This change will impact only the customers who are on **CleverTap for Startups under the Basic Plan**. To check the details of your current plan, log in to your CleverTap dashboard and navigate to *Organization* > *My Plan* section. 

### Q: Can we migrate to the Essentials Plan before April 1, 2024?

A: Yes, if you prefer the annual payment option, we can migrate you earlier than the scheduled date. If you wish to continue on a monthly subscription, all customers will be moved to Essentials on the planned date. For further queries, reach out to [CleverTap support](mailto:help@clevertap.com.).

### Q. Is migrating to the Essentials version mandatory, or can we continue with the Basic Plan?

A. It is mandatory to migrate to the Essentials Plan as the Basic Plan will cease to exist starting April 1, 2024. All new features and enhancements will be exclusively available on the Essentials Plan.

### Q. If the MAU count exceeds 100K, what are the options and potential overage charges under the CleverTap Essentials Plan?

A. If your MAU exceeds 100K on the Essentials Plan, you will receive guidance to explore plans designed for over 100K MAUs. These plans offer annual pricing, enhanced features, and better support for companies around the 100K MAU range. If you continue to remain on the same plan with 100K MAUs, you incur overages if usage exceeds 100K MAUs.

### Q. Can we get our old add-ons under the Essentials Plan?

A. No, old add-ons cannot be obtained under the Essentials Plan. We have bundled add-ons to provide the best available options. For more information, refer to the [Features and Add-Ons](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/features-add-ons) document. 

### Q. What should CleverTap X customers do now that their plan is being deprecated?

A. For a seamless transition, customers on quarterly or semi-annual billing cycles must consider switching to monthly or annual billing cycles. Moreover, choosing an annual billing cycle comes with a 30% discount. For more information, refer to the [Pricing](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/migration-to-clevertap-essentials-plan#pricing) section.

### Q. Why is my current Basic Plan price (INR) different from what is displayed in the Pricing table?

A. Some of our Basic customers who make payments in INR currently have a fixed exchange rate of\
1 USD = 70 INR. However, the currency exchange rates have changed over the years; the new pricing now reflects a conversion rate of 1 USD = 80 INR. As a result, certain customers may observe variations in their prices compared to the previous rate.
