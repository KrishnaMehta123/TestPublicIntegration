# How Referral Works

Earn **$100** in credits for each new customer who signs up using your referral and clears an invoice, in whole or in part, via a payment method. Invoices paid entirely with credits do not count as invoice clearing.

The following are the key elements of the offer for existing customers:

- **Email Notifications**: Both the referrer and referee receive an email when the referral is made and when the first invoice is paid.
