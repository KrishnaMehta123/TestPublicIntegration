# Overview

The WhatsApp Direct Add-on for CleverTap Essentials enables your business to engage with customers on WhatsApp without a separate Business Solution Provider (BSP). With this add-on, you get direct access to CleverTap’s WhatsApp BSP, allowing you to send campaigns, trigger journeys, and manage conversations seamlessly within CleverTap.

This add-on is ideal for startups and growing businesses that want a simple setup, transparent pricing, and complete control over message delivery.

Here’s why the WhatsApp Direct Add-on is the right choice for your business:

- **No external BSP required**: Use CleverTap’s WhatsApp Direct out of the box.
- **Seamless integration**: Configure WhatsApp under _Settings_ > _Channels_ immediately after purchase.
- **Transparent pricing**: Fixed platform fee + pre-paid credits, no hidden costs.
- **Control over usage**: Campaigns automatically stop when credits run out, preventing overages.

- A CleverTap Essentials account.
- Admin access to your organization’s account.

# Pricing and Billing

The WhatsApp Direct Add-on is billed at 20% of your base plan fee. The monthly fee will appear in your Chargebee invoice. Additionally, you must buy credits to send messages.
