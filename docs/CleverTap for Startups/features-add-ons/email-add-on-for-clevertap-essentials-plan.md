# Pricing and Billing

The Email Add-on comes with a fixed cost and a variable component based on overages for emails sent beyond the allotted quota. The following is the pricing structure for the Email Add-on:

| Component        | Details                                              |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Add-on Price** | $50 per month + 10% of your CleverTap base plan cost |
| **Overages**     | $0.0005 per email sent beyond the allotted quota     |

## Example Calculation

Suppose you are a CleverTap Essential customer with a base plan of $200 per month, and you have added the Email Add-on to enhance your email communication capabilities. If you send 10,000 emails over your allocated quota, your total monthly cost will be calculated as follows:

| Calculation Step             | Details                                                  | Amount          |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Base Plan Cost**           | Monthly base plan cost                                   | $200            |
| **Add-on Price (A)**         | $50 (fixed) + 10% of base plan ($200 x 10%)              | $50 + $20 = $70 |
| **Overage Cost (B)**         | Additional 10,000 emails beyond allotted quota x $0.0005 | $5              |
| **Total Monthly Cost (A+B)** | Add-on Price + Overage Cost                              | $70 + $5 = $75  |

## Warm Up Your IP

Gradually increasing email volume is crucial to maintaining optimal email deliverability. This process, known as IP Warm-up, helps establish a strong IP reputation and avoids potential deliverability issues. To warm up your IP, follow the IP warm-up guide sent via email post-purchase or refer to [IP Warm-up](doc:ip-warmup). The IP warm-up is a self-service process, requiring you to follow the provided documentation independently.

After the IP warm-up, you can start creating Email campaigns. For more information, refer to [Create Message](doc:create-message-email).
