# Account

You can effectively manage your CleverTap account with these key features and guidelines:

## Access Trial Account

## Manage Your Plan

As a paid subscriber, you can change your plan by upgrading or downgrading to another plan.

### MAU Tier Upgrade

You can upgrade to a higher MAU tier by following these steps:

1. Navigate to _Organization_ > _My Plan_ > _Change Plan_.
2. Choose the new MAU tier.
3. Click _Update Plan_ to confirm the upgrade.

The upgrade will be effective immediately, and a prorated charge for the current month will occur, including orders for any paid add-ons. A confirmation with the payment details and invoice will be sent to your registered billing address.

To upgrade to an MAU tier of more than 100,000  active users, we recommend upgrading to the CleverTap Enterprise plan to suit your organization's growing scale and needs. 

For more information on the plan and pricing, contact our team from the CleverTap dashboard.

### MAU Tier Downgrade

You can downgrade to a lower MAU tier by following these steps:

1. Navigate to _Organization_ > _My Plan_ > _Change Plan_.
2. Click **Downgrade** and select the required MAU tier.

2. Select the add-on you want.
3. Click _Update Plan_ to confirm.

### Add-ons Removal

Removing an add-on is as simple as adding one:

## Account Pause

You can pause your subscription by navigating to Organization> Billing > My Plan > Pause Plan. After initiating the pause, your account is instantly paused for 60 days. You can reactivate your subscription within 60 days of pausing. If you don't reactivate within this period, your account and data will be permanently deleted, and recovery of the account will not be possible.

To reactivate your account create a support ticket on [Help Center](https://help.clevertap.com/hc/en-us).

## Account Cancellation

The project admin can cancel the subscription by navigating to _Organization_ > _Billing_ > _My Plan_ > _Cancel Plan_. You are prompted to select the reason and enter **DELETE** in the acknowledgement field. 

After the account is cancelled, all the projects and corresponding data under the organization are deleted permanently and cannot be retrieved.

# Data Management

This section provides comprehensive insights into data retention policies, privacy protocols, data export options, and guidelines for ensuring secure and compliant data handling.

## Data Retention Policy

The default data retention policy for the CleverTap Essential plan is three years. CleverTap deletes all backups within 60 days of the customer deleting the data. 

The data of CleverTap for startup customers are stored in the EU region. Currently, there is no provision to store the data in other regions. If you are keen to change the region of the server/data center based on your preferences, we suggest you opt for the CleverTap Enterprise plan. 

This data can be exported using the Export option or an API. For more information, refer to [Export Data](doc:export).

## Privacy

Protecting customer data is always a priority at CleverTap, so we maintain globally recognized standards of data handling, best practices, and adherence to data transfer regulations. Compliance is assessed by independent, third-party auditors. CleverTap complies with GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA. You can read more about how we handle data privacy [here](https://clevertap.com/security?utm_source=C4Sdoc&utm_medium=doc&utm_campaign=KB).
