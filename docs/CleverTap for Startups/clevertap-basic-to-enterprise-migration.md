# Overview

CleverTap Essentials users can easily migrate to the enterprise plan with a self-served process without creating a new project/org in the CleverTap dashboard. 

# Migrate CleverTap Essentials Account to Enterprise

You will receive an email from our Billing Team containing a link to initiate the migration process.\
On clicking, you will be shown the projects that will be moved to the new enterprise plan.

If you have pending payments or have incurred overages, you must clear them by adding a card.

You may be eligible for credits depending upon the Enterprise Start Date mentioned on the contract. The credit information is shared after migration, and credits are automatically applied to your upcoming Enterprise Invoices.

After successful migration, you receive an email confirmation. Also, your CleverTap salesperson introduces you to your Customer Success Manager to seamlessly onboard you to your Enterprise plan.
