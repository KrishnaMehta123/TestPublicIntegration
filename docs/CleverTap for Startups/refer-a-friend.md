# Overview

CleverTap for Startups is thrilled to unveil the **Refer-a-Friend** program, where our Essentials Plan customers can refer leads — such as friends, peers, fellow cohort founders, or anyone from your network — and earn credits when a referred startup lead converts into a C4S customer. Build our community while earning promotional credits for each successful referral—everyone, including you and your network, wins.
