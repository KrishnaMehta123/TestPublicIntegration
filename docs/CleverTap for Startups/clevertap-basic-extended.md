      </td>

        <ul><li>5% discount</li><li>One free add-on</li></ul>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>CleverTap Basic - Semi Annual</p>
      </td>

      <td>
        <ul><li>10% discount</li><li>Two free add-ons</li></ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

These plans are of type MAU container where:

* Unused MAUs are rolled over to the next month within the same tenure.
* Overages are calculated after you have exhausted all the cumulative MAU of the tenure. You can choose to upgrade anytime or pay the overage.

For example, you select the Quarterly plan with the MAU Tier limit of 20,000 MAUs. This gives you a Total Billable Users Limit of 60,000 MAUs. If you exhaust 10,000 MAUs in the first month of your plan, you can use the remaining 10,000 MAUs of that month flexibly in the next two months.

The plans are auto-renewed by default.

# Key Terminologies

The following are some key terminologies to help you understand your plan's *Billing Summary* details. You can find the summary details by navigating to the *Organization* > *Billing* > *My Plan* page. 

* **MAU Tier Limit**: Displays the number of monthly active users you selected for your plan. 
* **Monthly Billable Users**: Reflects the highest value amongst MAU Tier Limit, MAU Actual Usage, or Processed MAU. Processed MAU is calculated as the total data points used divided by allowed data points per MAU (2,000 data points). In most cases, users perform fewer than 2,000 data points per month.
* **Total Billable Users Limit**: Displays the cumulative Monthly Billable Users for your overall tenure. If the same user visits the application in multiple months, it gets counted multiple times.
* **Remaining Billable Users**: Displays the remaining billable users you can attain in the current tenure.

> 📘 Switch to Monthly Tenure
>
> To switch back to Monthly tenure, you can email us at [selfserve@clevertap.com](mailto:selfserve@clevertap.com) or raise a ticket. When switching back to the monthly tenure plan, you will no longer be able to use the free add-ons.
