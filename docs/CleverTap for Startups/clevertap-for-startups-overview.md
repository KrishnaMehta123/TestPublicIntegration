The CleverTap for Startups Program is created to help early-stage startups leverage the benefits of CleverTap. Under this program, we offer the [Essentials Plan](doc:plans-and-programs), which starts at $75 a month for 5,000  Monthly Active Users(MAU). It is a pay-as-you-grow model that offers the flexibility of choosing the add-ons and provides the flexibility of monthly payments with no annual commitment. 

With this offering, startups can start using CleverTap from the beginning. There is a one-click option to migrate to the Enterprise plans once the startups have scaled up. This removes any hassle of switching to other solutions or doing manual migrations.

In the CleverTap for Startups Program, we work with the [CleverTap Leap](doc:plans-and-programs#leap-program) partner community, which consists of startup accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and the broader eco-system. Together, we offer special advantages and discounts on the CleverTap Essential Plan to their startup portfolio or network.

Our partner program benefits both current and alumni-affiliated startups. You can find more details and check your eligibility for the Leap Program [here](https://clevertap.com/leap/?utm_source=C4S&utm_medium=doc&utm_campaign=KB).

CleverTap can be integrated into your website or app. It helps startups understand their customers and engage them to grow their businesses.
