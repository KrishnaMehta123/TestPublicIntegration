# Overview

You can import user and event data from third-party SFTP clients, such as BigQuery, HANA, Salesforce, and so on, to the CleverTap SFTP server. After establishing a connection with CleverTap SFTP, you can automatically import data to our dashboard at regular intervals. You can then use the power of our analytics, segmentation, and experiences to enhance engagement and retention.

> 📘 File Upload Encryption
>
> To upload encrypted file to CleverTap using SFTP, refer to [File Upload Encryption](https://staging.docs.user.clevertap.net/docs/file-upload-encryption).

# Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites for importing data via SFTP:

* You must have an SFTP client to import data into CleverTap's SFTP server.
* Ensure that your plan includes the SFTP feature.

# Establish Connection with SFTP Server

The CleverTap SFTP server needs to recognize the SFTP client to start receiving files. To establish this secured file transfer connection:

1. Go to _Settings_ > _Partner_ > _Import_ and click **SFTP** .

2. Select the _Saved Keys_ tab and click **+ Add key**. On clicking, _Add new import key_ popup opens.

<Image align="center" alt={492} border={true} caption="Add New Import Key" title="Add New Import Key" src="https://files.readme.io/cdd0fcc-AWS_Data_Import_credentials_add.png" />

3. Enter the following details:

| Field                     | Description                                                                        |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Username                  | Prepopulated field that displays your CleverTap Account ID.                        |
| Name your import key      | Enter the name for your import key.                                                |
| Paste your SSH public key | Enter the SSH key pair generated and shared with Clevertap in the public key file. |

After our SFTP server receives the SSH public key, a user is created for you. After successful authentication, you can seamlessly start transferring data files. You can refer to the server URL at the bottom of the _Saved Keys_ tab for connecting to the SFTP URL.

# Import Files via SFTP

To import files, use any SFTP client and execute the following commands from the command prompt to upload your files:

1. `sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@serverURL`
2. `put filename.csv`
3. `put file.manifest`

You receive an email notification for the following:

* When the file is picked up for processing.
* When it takes longer than expected to process the file, you receive an email notification for file processing every 2 hours till the time file is processed.
* Upon successful file upload and processing.
* When the import fails for some reason, you receive a failure email with a CSV file attachment containing failed records' details. You can download this CSV file and check it for errors.

> 📘 Private Beta Release
>
> The above feature of sending an email notification to users at different milestones is released in private Beta.

Moreover, you can start using this data in our engagement channels.  
The following is an example of an error file. The last column in this file displays all the errors.

# Sample CSV Files for Upload

You can upload profiles or events data to CleverTap with an SFTP client. All files (Events and Profiles) must be uploaded in CSV format.

> ❗️ Order of File Upload
>
> A manifest file upload must follow each CSV file upload to map your data upload with CleverTap properties. The data file processing will start only after the manifest file is uploaded.

## Events CSV file

The events CSV file contains all the event details you want to send to CleverTap. The events file has the following fields:

### Operations for Profile Properties

You can use the following operations on profile properties:

* $add - This operation will add value to the property array. For example,  you can add rock songs as  Playlist values.
* $remove- This operation will remove the value from the property array. For example, you can remove Pop from the existing Playlist.
* $set - Use this operation to replace the current value. In our example, the phone number will be set as "+918876543213."
* $delete - This operation removes the property. For example, you can completely remove the property id_phone for Jane Roe and all the values in it.

### Communication Preferences for Profiles

The following are the communication preferences available:

* MSG-sms: This field in the file helps to know if the user wants to be notified via an SMS or not.
* MSG-email: This field in the file helps to know if the user wants to be notified via email or not.
* MSG-whatsapp: This field in the file helps to know if the user wants to be notified via WhatsApp channel or not.
* MSG-push: This field in the file helps to know if the user wants to be notified via a push notification or not.
* MSG-dndSMS: This field in the file helps to know if the user has enabled DND for SMS notifications.
* MSG-dndWhatsApp: This field in the file helps to know if the user has enabled DND for WhatsApp notifications.
* MSG-dndEmail: This field in the file helps to know if the user has enabled DND for email notifications.

> 📘 Note

> To add or remove multiple values in a property, create a separate row for each value.

# Sample Manifest File for Upload

The manifest file is a JSON file that maps the custom attributes in your CSV files with CleverTap properties. The format for the manifest file is `anyfilename.manifest`. Every manifest file must have a unique name. The following keys are mandatory in a manifest file:

| <p>Expected keys</p> | <p>Description</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| <p>type</p>          | <p>The event/profile/(any other type of data that we may support in the future).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| <p>fileName</p>      | <p>The name of the data file.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| <p>clientEmail</p>   | <p>This is a mandatory field.  We send the update mails to this email ID.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <p>columns</p>       | <p>This is an optional field. </p><ul><li>ctName - This is an optional field. The actual property name in CleverTap.</li><li>dataType - This is an optional field. The supported dataTypes are STRING, INTEGER, FLOAT, BOOLEAN, and LONG. If a dataType is not defined, then it is considered STRING.</li></ul> |

> 📘 Manifest Note
>
> If a column is not mapped to a CleverTap property name, the data is processed with the column name as the property name.

## Manifest File for Events

Create a manifest file to map your custom events to CleverTap Events. The following is a sample manifest file for events:

```json
{
    "fileName": "events.csv",
    "type": "event",
    "columns": {
        "event_name": {
            "ctName": "evtName",
                "dataType": "STRING"
        },

The status for each file is sent via email.

# Receive Imports Notification

The data files are picked up for ingestion in the order in which they are uploaded. You can configure a webhook to receive notifications for the following:

* When the file is picked up for processing.
* When it takes longer than expected to process the file, you receive an email notification for file processing every 2 hours till the time file is processed.
* Upon successful file upload and processing.
* When the import fails for some reason, you receive a failure email with a CSV file attachment containing failed records' details. You can download this CSV file and check it for errors.

To configure a webhook, click **Receive Notifications** and choose an already configured webhook from the list.

# View imports

After a successful import, you can view your imported files on the CleverTap dashboard.  
Click _Settings_ > _Import_ > _Activity log_ tab to check for your uploaded files. This tab displays your uploaded files and their status.

# Supported Date Time Format

CleverTap supports multiple Date Time formats, as shown in the following table:

| Format               |
| :------------------- |
| dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss  |
| MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss  |
| yyyy/dd/MM HH:mm:ss  |
| yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss  |
| dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss |
| Unix                 |

> 📘 Key Points to Remember
>
> * CleverTap supports uploading more than one field of type DATE with different date formats
> * If the timestamp is missing in any of the fileds of type DATE, CleverTap adds the default timestamp of 00:00:01 to the date value included in the file when uploading it to the dashboard. For example, if the format defined  in the manifest file for a particular DATE field is `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss` and the file includes the value as `14/04/2023`, then the CleverTap stores the value as `14/04/2023 00:00:01` to the dashboard.

| Validation Errors            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax Errors**            | Ensure you use the correct JSON syntax. Avoid any mismatch, such as missing or extra commas, improperly closed brackets, or missing quotes around keys or values. An email is not sent to the client if this error occurs.                                       |
| **Invalid Data Types**       | Ensure data types are in the following format: STRING, INTEGER, FLOAT, BOOLEAN, and LONG. A wrong or misspelled data type can lead to an invalid manifest error. For example, using int instead of INTEGER. An email is sent to the client if this error occurs. |
| **Invalid Client Email ID**  | Ensure the client's email ID is valid. The client does not receive an error notification email if the email ID is invalid.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Invalid Event Type**       | Ensure you specify the event type in the manifest as either _EVENT_ or _PROFILE_.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Invalid File Format**      | Ensure the events file name is specified in the manifest and provided in _.csv_ format.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Invalid Date Time Format** | Ensure the date time format is valid. For more information, refer to [Supported Date Time Format](https://staging.docs.dev.clevertap.net/docs/imports-via-sftp#supported-date-time-format).                                                                      |

> 📘 Note
