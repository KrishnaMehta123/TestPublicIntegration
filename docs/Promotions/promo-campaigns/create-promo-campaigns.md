# Overview

This document provides detailed instructions on creating and configuring a Promo Campaign using the Campaign Builder. It guides you through the key steps to set up your campaign, including defining your campaign goals, selecting the right target audience, choosing the campaign type, and customizing your settings.

# Create Promo Campaign

Go to _Promotions_ > _Promo Campaigns_ and click **Create Campaign**. The _New Promotion Campaign_ page opens. To create a Promo Campaign, perform the following five key steps:

1. [Define Qualification Criteria](doc:create-promo-campaigns#define-qualification-criteria)
2. [Select Target Segment](doc:create-promo-campaigns#select-target-segment)
3. [Set Up Reward](doc:create-promo-campaigns#set-up-reward)
4. [Set Up Delivery Preference](doc:create-promo-campaigns#set-up-delivery-preferences)
5. [Publish Campaign](doc:create-promo-campaigns#publish-campaign)

## Define Qualification Criteria

The _Start Here_ section is where you choose how users will qualify for the reward. The qualification criteria provide the following options:

* **Past behavior/Custom list**: Target users based on actions performed in the past or a custom list uploaded to the CleverTap dashboard. For example, you can target users who have not done a transaction in the last 6 months, and offer them a 20% discount coupon.
* **Live behavior**: Trigger rewards in real-time when a user performs or does not perform an event. For example, you can trigger a reward when a user adds items to their cart but does not complete the checkout process within a set timeframe.

## Select Target Segment

The _Who_ section allows you to define who should receive the reward using the rule builder. The _Target Segment_ rule builder lets you select users from an existing saved segment or create a new segment using event and property-based rules as follows:

* **Find users from segment**: Select users from a saved segment or define a new one.
* **Create rules based on events**: Build custom logic using event and property-based conditions
  * Users who **have done** specific events
  * Users who **have not done** certain events
  * Users who **have common user properties**, such as device type and location, are part of a particular segment, and so on.
  * Users who **have common interests** or share common behavioral traits or usage patterns, such as frequent shoppers or high-engagement users.
* Option to enable **Constant event property**, which keeps event property values fixed during evaluation. It is useful when comparing multiple events with shared attributes. For example, you can lock the Product ID property across both events to find users who viewed and purchased the same product.

## Set Up Reward

The **What** section allows you to define the **reward type** for your Promo Campaign. Depending on your selection, the configuration options vary. CleverTap supports the following reward types:

* [Loyalty Points](doc:create-promo-campaigns#loyalty-points)
* [Coupons](doc:create-promo-campaigns#coupons)
* [Partner Vouchers](doc:create-promo-campaigns#partner-vouchers)
* [Custom Rewards](doc:create-promo-campaigns#custom-rewards)

## Set Up Delivery Preferences

The _When_ section defines when the campaign starts and ends, and the controls available vary based on whether you select a _Past Behavior Segment (PBS)_ or a _Live Behavior Segment_.

### For Past Behavior Segments or Custom List (PBS)

When you select Past Behavior or Custom List Segment, the _When_ section shows the following options:

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                       | Example / Use Case                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Send Now**           | Launches the campaign immediately using the current timestamp and the **account timezone** (for example, GMT+05:30 Asia/Kolkata). | Run a flash-sale promotion as soon as it is configured.                             |
| **Schedule for Later** | Let's you choose a **future start date and time**. You can also adjust the timezone if required.                                  | Schedule a promo to start at 6:00 PM on a Friday evening to capture higher traffic. |

# Reward Types

Each reward type includes different configuration settings, described in the sections below:

## Loyalty Points

Use Loyalty Points to incentivize users with loyalty points that can be accumulated and redeemed within your app or platform. This option requires that wallets be pre-created in your CleverTap account.

The following configuration options are available when Loyalty Points is selected:

<Table align={["left","left","left","left"]}>

        Past Behavior/Custom List + Live Behavior Segments
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Points earning scheme**
      </td>

      <td>
        Define how points are calculated when users qualify. Options include:

        * **Flat**: A fixed number of points for each qualifying user.
        * **Percentage**: Points calculated as a percentage of an event property (for example, order amount).
        * **Proportional**: Points awarded per defined unit of an event property.
        * **Random**: Points assigned from a defined range; exposes Value Range + Distribution Bias controls.
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Flat**: Every eligible user earns 100 points regardless of order amount.
        * **Percentage**: If set to 10% of the amount, a ₹500 purchase earns 50 points.
        * **Proportional**: For every ₹100 spent, the user gets 10 points.
        * **Random**: Users earn between 10 and 50 points, with distribution bias favoring the average.
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Flat** and **Random**: Available in both Past Behavior/Custom List and Live Behavior segments.
        * **Percentage** and **Proportional**: Available only in Live Behavior segments
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Points value**
      </td>

      <td>
        The input control for Points value changes based on the selected Points Earning Scheme:

        * **Flat**: Enter a single fixed value of points/credits awarded to each qualifying user.
        * **Percentage**: Define a percentage of a selected event property (for example, order amount) from the qualifying event (typically a Charged event).
        * **Proportional**: Define "points per unit" of a selected event property (for example, for every X units of the property, award Y points).
        * **Random**: Set a min–max range of points/credits; the system randomly selects a value within this range for each qualifying user (also supports Distribution Bias).
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Flat**: Set to 100 means every qualifying user gets 100 credits.
        * **Percentage**: Set to 10% means a purchase of ₹500 (as per selected event property) gives 50 credits.
        * **Proportional**: Set to 10 credits for every Rs. 100 (per selected event property).
        * **Random**: Set to a range of 10–100 means each qualifying user gets a random value between 10 and 100.
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Flat** and **Random**: Available in both Past Behavior/Custom List and Live Behavior Segment.
        * **Percentage** and **Proportional**: Available only in Live Behavior campaigns.

      </td>

      <td>
        Control distribution pattern that allows you to select the following options:

        * **Favor Min**: Skews distribution toward the lower end of the range.
        * **Favor Avg**: Skews distribution toward the midpoint of the range.
        * **Favor Max**: Skews distribution toward the higher end of the range.
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Favor Min**: For a range of 10–100 points, most users receive lower values (for example, 10–30), while fewer receive higher values.
        * **Favor Avg**: For a range of 10–100 points, most users receive values around the midpoint (for example, ~55), with fewer at the extremes.
        * **Favor Max**: For a range of 10–100 points, most users receive higher values (for example, 70–100), while fewer receive lower values.

      <td>
        Define the budget to control how rewards are distributed. Budget can be set at two levels:

        * **Per Campaign Budget**: Caps the total rewards that the campaign can distribute.
        * **Per User Budget**: Caps the maximum rewards a single user can receive during the campaign.  
          Once the defined limit is reached (per user or for the entire campaign), no further rewards are issued.
      </td>

      <td>
        If the Per Campaign Budget is 5,000 points, rewards stop once the campaign collectively distributes 5,000 points, even if more users qualify.  
        If the Per User Budget is 500 points, each user can only receive up to 500 points during the campaign, even if they continue qualifying.

        * **Custom Key**: Define your own key. <br />Duplicate keys are not allowed.
      </td>

      <td>
        Add `{'{'}' "orderId": "12345", "promoType": "festival" {'}'}` as custom metadata to track order-related rewards.

  **Points to Consider**

  * Custom Activation does not check user behavior. It delays redemption so businesses can increase net profit on orders.
  * Wallet must be pre-configured in your account.

        * **Proportional**: Define "credits per unit" of a selected event property (for example, for every X units of the property, award Y credits).
        * **Random**: Set a min–max range of credits; the system randomly selects a value within this range for each qualifying user (also supports Distribution Bias).
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Flat**: Set to 100 means every qualifying user gets 100 credits.
        * **Percentage**: Set to 10% means a purchase of ₹500 (as per selected event property) gives 50 credits.
        * **Proportional**: Set to 10 credits for every ₹100 (as per selected event property).
        * **Random**: Set to a range of 10–100 means each qualifying user gets a random value between 10 and 100.

> 📘 **Points to Consider**
>
> Before you begin:
>
> * Ensure you configure the webhook endpoint before creating the campaign.
> * Verify that the endpoint can handle campaign volume, retries, and logging.
>
> During setup:
>
> * Physical & Digital Rewards and Self-managed Wallet Credits have separate configuration options; choose the appropriate type based on your use case.
> * The reward payload is fully customizable and scales automatically with campaign volume.
> * Custom Rewards give maximum flexibility but require your external system to handle issuance and redemption.

### JSON Payload for Custom Rewards

```json
{
  "user": {
    "userId": "12345",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890"
  },
  "reward": {
    "type": "custom",
    "value": 100,
    "metadata": {
      "orderType": "electronics",
      "promoType": "festival"
    }
  }
}
```

# Best Practices

Maximize campaign effectiveness and avoid common pitfalls with the following best practices for setup, execution, and management:

* **Use Segments Wisely**: Tailor rewards with meaningful segmentation.
* **Test Before Scaling**: Start small to validate campaign performance.
* **Set Limits**: Always define per-user and per-campaign limits.
* **Reward Inventory**: Ensure sufficient reward stock throughout the campaign.
