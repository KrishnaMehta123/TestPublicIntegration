## Status and Actions

The **Status** of a Promo Campaign reflects its current stage in the campaign lifecycle and determines which actions can be performed. Properly managing campaign statuses ensures effective control over reward distribution and campaign performance.

The table below outlines each Promo Campaign's list status, its description, and the actions you can perform:

| Status        | Description                                                          | Available Actions |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Draft**     | Campaign is saved but not yet active or scheduled.                   | Edit, Archive     |
| **Scheduled** | Campaign is set to go live at a future date/time.                    | Edit, Stop        |
| **Running**   | Campaign is currently live and rewarding eligible users.             | Pause, Stop       |
| **Stopped**   | Campaign has been manually ended before completion or archived.      | Archive           |
| **Completed** | Campaign has naturally ended after reaching the configured end time. | Archive           |

| **Archive** | Permanently deletes a campaign.                                                       |

## Best Practices for Campaign Management

Follow these best practices to maintain campaign quality, control, and consistency:

- **Use Drafts for Iteration**: Build campaigns in _Draft_ mode, review, and schedule when finalized.
- **Monitor Status Regularly**: Use the status column on the list page to ensure campaigns are behaving as expected.
