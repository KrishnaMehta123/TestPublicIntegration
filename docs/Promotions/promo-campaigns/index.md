# Overview

Promo Campaigns are a flexible and powerful feature that enables businesses to engage their users by distributing targeted rewards. Campaigns can be triggered based on users' past behavior or in real time based on their actions (or inactions). The Promo Campaigns system supports various types of rewards, including wallet points, coupons, and partner vouchers.

# Example Use Cases

The following are some of the examples that illustrate how Promo Campaigns can deliver its value:

* **E-commerce**: Reward high spenders with percentage-based wallet points or offer discount coupons when users abandon their cart.
* **Delivery**: Distribute cashback wallet points to users for orders placed during off-peak hours, or send discount coupons to those who have not placed an order in the last 30 days.
* **Travel and Hospitality**: Offer loyalty points for bookings exceeding a specific value, or run a promotional campaign offering coupons for early-bird or last-minute hotel bookings.
* **Fintech**: Provide wallet points or vouchers to users who complete their first UPI transaction or run reward campaigns based on bill payments. For example, reward users 100 points when they deposit $100.
* **Gaming and Entertainment**: Offer 10% off on movie ticket bookings or distribute partner vouchers when users perform specific in-app actions, such as watching a trailer or making a purchase.
* **Healthcare and Wellness**: Offer wallet points for booking health checkups or consultations, or run promotional campaigns offering vouchers for app signups or referrals.

# FAQs

Find answers to the following common questions about using ̉Promo Campaigns:

### Can I target both live actions and past behavior in a single campaign?

No, each campaign supports only one type of segmentation: Past Behavior, Live Actions, or Custom Lists.

### What happens if the reward inventory is exhausted?

The system stops distributing rewards once the limit is reached. For bulk coupons, an alert is shown if you exceed the available codes.

### Can I reuse a coupon series in multiple campaigns?

Yes, you can reuse the same bulk coupon series across multiple campaigns. The system always assigns a unique code to each eligible user, even if they qualify in different campaigns using the same series. This ensures that users will never receive duplicate codes from the same series across campaigns.
