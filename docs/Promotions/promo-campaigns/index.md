# FAQs

Find answers to the following common questions about using ̉Promo Campaigns:

### Can I target both live actions and past behavior in one campaign?

No, each campaign supports only one type of segmentation: Past Behavior, Live Actions, or Custom Lists.

The system stops distributing rewards once the limit is reached. For bulk coupons, an alert is shown if you exceed the available codes.

### Can I reuse a coupon series in multiple campaigns?

Yes, but ensure the format is unique, and your users do not receive duplicate codes across campaigns.
