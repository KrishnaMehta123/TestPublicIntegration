# Overview

CleverTap's Promo engine empowers you to drive customer loyalty and boost sales with tailored reward strategies that integrate seamlessly across web and mobile platforms.

You can engage with your customers through the following four reward types:

## Loyalty Wallets

Engage your customers with a flexible, credit-based reward points system that lets you create, manage, and track wallet credits, monitor detailed transactions and balance changes, configure expiry policies and rounding rules, and more.

For more information, refer to [Loyalty Wallets](doc:loyalty-wallets).

## Coupons

Drive promotions with targeted coupon campaigns that enable you to boost conversions and customer retention by creating various coupon types (single, bulk, and campaign-based), managing discount rules and redemption limits, tracking performance through real-time analytics, and so on.

For more information, refer to [Coupons](doc:coupons).

## Partner Vouchers

Simplify voucher management with partner vouchers to streamline the distribution process. They allow you to upload, manage, and track vouchers from partner brands, map vouchers to promo campaigns for targeted engagement, leverage event metadata to trigger personalized communications, and more.

For more information, refer to [Partner Vouchers](doc:partner-vouchers).

## Custom Rewards

Integrate your own reward or partner systems with CleverTap through Custom Rewards. They let you create and distribute external rewards, such as gift cards, digital subscriptions, physical items, or wallet-based credits, directly through Promo campaigns using secure webhook integrations.

For more information, refer to [Custom Rewards](doc:custom-rewards).
