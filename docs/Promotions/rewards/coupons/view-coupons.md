This page is divided into the following two tabs based on the coupon lifecycle status:

* **Available**: Displays the coupons that are active, scheduled, paused, or in draft state. These coupons are still active, editable, or scheduled for future use.
* **Archived**: Displays the coupons that have expired or been manually archived. These coupons are no longer active and are view-only. You can use this tab to review historical coupon data and past promotions.

Each tab displays key details for every coupon in a tabular format, including status, type, usage, linked campaigns, and more.
