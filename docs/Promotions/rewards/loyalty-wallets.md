# Overview

The Loyalty Wallet is a digital system that allows businesses to store and reward loyalty points earned by customers for actions such as purchases, referrals, reviews, and so on. Customers can later redeem these points for discounts or exclusive benefits.

CleverTap’s Loyalty Wallets feature provides a flexible, credit-based engagement strategy that allows businesses to seamlessly manage points ledger and distribute wallet points. By leveraging this feature, businesses can enhance user interactions, drive repeat purchases, and build stronger customer relationships.

This document explains how to configure, manage, and utilize the Loyalty Wallet across various websites and mobile platforms.

# Prerequisites

Before using the Wallet feature, check the following:

* You have enabled the Loyalty Wallets feature on your CleverTap account.
* You have the necessary permissions to configure and manage wallet points.
* You have a Wallet already created for your account to integrate the [Wallet APIs](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/wallet-apis).

# Features

The following are the key features of the Loyalty Wallets:

* **Wallet Points**: Loyalty points assigned to customers that can be redeemed for discounts, offers, or in-app purchases. Points can be credited through various sources such as promotional campaigns, cashback coupons, APIs, and CleverTap dashboard. Different reward types are supported, such as fixed points, percentage-based points, proportional points, and random points based on their probability factors.
* **Wallet Transactions**: Tracks all wallet-related transactions for a user, including point credits, debits, promises, and expiry. Loyalty points can be credited via promo campaigns, the Wallet Credit API, cashback coupons, or the CleverTap dashboard. Debits occur through the [Wallet Debit API](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/debitcredit-wallet) when users redeem points or the points expire.
* **Points Expiration**: Wallets can be set up with a point expiration duration, which defines the time period in days, weeks, hours, or minutes after which rewarded points will automatically expire. This approach encourages timely usage and increases engagement.
