| Unable to Activate Voucher List | Check if the expiration date is in the future. You cannot reactivate an expired voucher list without extending its validity.                                                                                                                   |
| Error Uploading Codes           | <li>Ensure the file format is .CSV.</li> <li>Verify that all voucher codes are correctly formatted and do not contain invalid characters.</li>  <li>The file should contain only one column with voucher codes—no comma-separated values.</li> |
| Missing Campaign Linkage        | If a voucher list is not linked to a campaign, review the campaign settings to ensure proper mapping.                                                                                                                                          |
