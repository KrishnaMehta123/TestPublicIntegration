      </th>

      <th>
        Resolution
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Unable to Activate Voucher List
      </td>

      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Error Uploading Codes
      </td>

      <td>
        <li>Ensure the file format is .CSV.</li> <li>Verify that all voucher codes are correctly formatted and do not contain invalid characters.</li>  <li>The file should contain only one column with voucher codes—no comma-separated values.</li>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Missing Campaign Linkage
      </td>

      <td>
