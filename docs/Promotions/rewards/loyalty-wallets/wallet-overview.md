## Summary

The _Summary_ section provides the current status of all the loyalty wallet points in the following way:

### Key Metrics

Track the real-time status of the loyalty points available for users and those scheduled for future credit with the following key metrics:

* **Active Points:** Total points currently available for use.
* **Promised Points:** Points earned by customers but are yet to be credited to the active points bucket based on the points activation date.

### Points Breakdown

Analyze the distribution of loyalty points, including issued, expired, redeemed, and manually adjusted points in the following ways:

* **Issued Points:** Total points awarded to users within the selected date range through various sources, such as:
  * **Cashback Coupon**: Points credited when a cashback coupon is redeemed. For example, a user redeems a coupon called _SAVE50_ and earns 50 points.
  * **Promo Campaigns**: Points credited via marketing promotions. For example, a festival sale campaign credits 100 points.
  * **Wallet Credit API**: Points credited via the Credit Wallet API. For example, an automated credit of 30 points triggered by a system workflow or a manual credit of 50 points by an admin using the API for customer support resolution.
  * **Manual Credit**: Points credited manually via the CleverTap dashboard. For example, an Admin credits 20 points to an irate customer through the CleverTap dashboard.
* **Expired Points:** Total points that were unused within their validity period.
* **Redeemed Points:** Total points debited via the Debit API.
* **Removed Points:** Points deducted or revoked due to manual adjustments made through the CleverTap Wallet dashboard.

> 📘 Ledger Balance Calculation
>
> The ledger balance is calculated with the following formula:  
> **Active Points** = Issued Points – (Redeemed Points + Removed Points + Expired Points)
>
> Where,  
> **Issued Points** = Points Rewarded via Campaign + Points Rewarded via API + Points Rewarded Manually via Dashboard

## Setup Details Section

This section provides the following information about the wallet configuration:

* **Created On:** Date when the loyalty wallet was created.
* **Created By:** Email of the user who created the wallet.
* **Loyalty Wallet Name:** The name of the wallet.
* **Loyalty Points Name:** The name of the points used in the wallet.
* **Wallet ID:** Unique identifier for the loyalty wallet.
* **Rounding Rules:** Displays the rounding rule applied to points.
* **Points Expiry:** Indicates whether points expire and the applicable expiry policy.
