# Overview

Marketing campaigns promote products through different types of media. Campaigns are designed with different goals in mind, including building a brand image, introducing a new product, and increasing sales of an existing product. Defining a campaign's goal usually influences the required marketing efforts and identifies the most effective media channels for targeting a particular audience. Read on to learn more about CleverTap campaigns.

# Messaging Channels

CleverTap offers different messaging channels for creating engagement strategies to help users with a personalized message at the right time. Click **+ Campaigns** and select the messaging channels from the list of available channels in CleverTap. These messaging channels can be broadly classified into four categories: Mobile Channels, Web Channels, Remarketing Channels, and Additional Channels.

## Mobile Channels

The mobile channels include:

### [Push](doc:push)

Push notifications enable you to communicate with your users when they are not in your app. Depending on the platform and user configuration, these messages appear on a user's lock screen or in a top/bottom banner.

### [In-App Messages](doc:in-app)

In-app messages are pop-up messages that are shown to the user while they are in your app. While the user views push notifications outside the app, in-app notifications are viewed inside the app.  
In-app notifications are great for showing contextual messages, such as discount offers while the user is within the app or communicating with users who have turned off push notifications.

### [App Inbox](doc:app-inbox)

App Inbox is a messaging channel that provides the ability to deliver rich, individually customized content to your users. Messages sent to the App Inbox get saved on the user's device.

### [Native Display](doc:native-display)

Native Display provides the ability to embed content natively within your app screen without interrupting the app experience. It also provides the ability to change your app's content dynamically and deliver relevant and contextual content to your users.

## Web Channels

The web channels include:

### [Web Push](doc:web-push)

Web Push notifications are browser-based messages you can send to your desktop or mobile web users even if they are not currently visiting your website.

### [Web Pop-up](doc:web-pop-ups)

Web pop-ups are interstitial messages displayed to the user while they are on the desktop or mobile website.

### [Web Exit Intent](doc:web-exit-intent-overview)

Exit Intent messages are similar to Web Pop-ups, except they are triggered when a user navigates away from your website.

## Remarketing Channels

The remarketing channels include:

### [Facebook Audiences](doc:facebook-audiences)

Facebook Custom Audience is a great way to re-engage your users outside of your app through ads on Facebook. The Facebook Audience module on the CleverTap Dashboard makes it easy to set up Facebook Audience ads for all your users or specific user segments. Base these segments on past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties.

### [Google Ads](doc:google-adwords)

Remarketing with Google Ads is a great way to re-engage with users outside your app or website via the Google Ads network.

## Additional Channels

### [Email](doc:email)

In CleverTap, you create the email content, specify the target audience, and determine when the campaign activates. CleverTap delivers the email messages to the third-party email service provider of your choice via a simple configuration in the Dashboard.

### [Webhooks](doc:webhooks-overview)

CleverTap webhooks enable developers to monitor specific user events and receive data on their servers directly in the JSON format when those events occur. Each qualified user's details are sent to the endpoint, which exports data to a third-party system.

### [SMS](doc:sms)

SMS notifications enable you to send short communications to your users, such as reactivating users who have uninstalled the app or providing links to download the latest version of the mobile app.

# Campaigns

You can create new campaigns and view existing ones under **Campaigns**, which is available in the left pane. Once a campaign is published, you can stop it but cannot pause it.

# Journeys

[Journeys](doc:journeys) is a visual campaign builder to create an omnichannel messaging experience for your users. Journeys are ideal for engaging users across the lifecycle of your app. 

Here are a few sample use cases for Journeys:

- Build User Onboarding Journeys that engage users over several days or weeks and on different channels as you educate them about your service.
- Build Promotional Journeys to entice your users to transact at different points in time.
- Long-running re-engagement campaigns to pull users back into your service if they begin to slip away.

# Message Labels

Message Labels enable you to categorize campaigns with descriptive names or themes, facilitating the grouping and analysis of campaign performance and user behavior.

For instance, you can create a label such as _Onboarding_ to categorize campaigns related to new user onboarding across all channels. Alternatively, a label such as _Re-engage_ can be used for campaigns aimed at re-engaging inactive users. Similarly, a label such as _Score Updates_ can be applied to notifications providing match updates.

Labels can be created under the _Message Settings_ menu, allowing for the creation of multiple labels simultaneously. The labels cannot start with or contain the following symbols: ”, \, %, >, \<, and !

        "https://files.readme.io/f9cd0350976bbbb7452a822ff49fc74ccbdfe2ff3fdde71476a1b352e7aafc5b-Apply_Labels_to_Campaigns.gif",
        null,
        "Create Multiple Message Labels"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Create Multiple Message Labels"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can create a maximum of 900 labels on the CleverTap dashboard. Labels can be applied to individual campaigns during creation or using the _Edit Campaign_ option from the _All Campaigns_ page.

## Segments and Message Labels

One of the more powerful uses of Labels is the combination with CleverTap Segmentation features. Each time a message is delivered to a user, CleverTap will record a Notification Sent event. As a Property of this event, we include any label that you have assigned to that messaging campaign. 

Then from our Find People, Create Segment, or any other Analytics feature, you can isolate users who have been sent a messaging campaign with a particular Label.

For example, you may want to see the 30-day retention of users who were sent Onboarding messages to judge whether these messages were having an impact. After creating a label called _Onboarding_ and associating it with all the relevant campaigns, you can create a new segment and then filter your cohort analysis for 30-day retention to isolate the performance of only these users.
