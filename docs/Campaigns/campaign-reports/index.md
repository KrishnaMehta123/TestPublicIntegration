# Overview

Campaign reports provide you with campaign performance at a glance. Using these reports, you can compare the performance of campaigns and understand engagement trends. You can email or export the summary report of all campaigns sent out for a specific period or even for a particular day. This report includes metrics such as campaign deliveries, engagements, conversions, and errors. To optimize dashboard performance, the data in the report is cached, allowing you to receive data that has been generated up to 4 hours prior. The report may take up to 6 hours, depending on the other activities that are happening when the report is requested.

The following are the two types of campaign reports that you can fetch from the CleverTap dashboard:

* **One-Time Reports**: The report encompasses comprehensive campaign statistics for the chosen campaigns, considering the applied filters.
* **Recurring Reports**: You can set up either _Daily_ or _Weekly_ recurring reports. When you select _Daily_, the reports encompass statistics for all campaigns from the preceding day, taking into consideration the applied filters. When you select _Weekly_, the reports encompass statistics for all the campaigns from the last seven days, taking into consideration the applied filters. The reports include statistics for a campaign marked as _Completed_ as long as data is available for the campaign based on the applied filters.

# Generate Reports

The campaigns list page allows you to view the campaigns. From here, you can email a report or export it to a storage bucket on Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.

To view a report:

1. Navigate to the _Campaigns_ page from the main menu. The Campaign List page opens.
2. Select the campaigns or select the filter criteria to export the reports for the required campaigns.

# Subscribe to Reports

You may want to subscribe to a report in various scenarios. For example, select and subscribe to 4 campaigns on a monthly recurrence, or only subscribe to push campaigns that you created with a label for a monthly/daily recurrence.

The subscriptions are displayed on the _Subscriptions_ tab of the _Campaign Report_ window. To create a new report or create a new report subscription, refer to [Generate Reports](doc:campaign-reports#generate-reports).

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### **Important**

  For Message via Identity campaigns using tag groups, the default download and subscription reports display consolidated statistics, such as Sent, Viewed, and Clicked, for all tag groups in a single row.

  To access a detailed breakdown with each tag group displayed in its own row, you can:

  * Download the report for the specific Message via Identity campaign, or
  * Create an individual subscription for that campaign.

Exported report files follow this naming convention: _\{ReportName}_\{Timestamp}.\{Extension}_, where the Timestamp indicates the time when the report is delivered. For example,_WeeklyPerformance_2025-11-04.csv_. You can view your campaign reports by navigating to `<accountID>/reports/` from your partner bucket.

> 📘 **Conversion Tracking Rules**
>
> To understand how CleverTap tracks conversions, it is essential to note the following rules:
>
> * User is considered converted if they complete a conversion event within the conversion timeline.
>
> * User is only counted as converted once for a particular conversion event within a campaign. For example, if a user completes the same conversion event multiple times within the same conversion timeline, it will only be counted once.
>
> * If a user completes a conversion event within the same timeline for multiple campaigns, it is attributed to all the campaigns.
>
> * A user is considered converted even if they do not open or click the message as long as they complete the conversion event within the conversion timeline. This is known as an influenced conversion.
