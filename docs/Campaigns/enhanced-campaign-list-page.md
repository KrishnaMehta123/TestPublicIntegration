# Overview

Campaigns promote products through various media types and are designed with specific goals, such as building brand awareness, introducing new products, or driving conversions.

The campaign listing page in CleverTap helps you manage all your campaigns efficiently. It allows you to filter them, edit columns, view performance, organize using labels, and more. This guide walks you through all key operations on the new campaigns page.

# Campaigns Operations

You can perform different actions on the campaigns from the _All Campaigns_ page, including filtering, labeling, editing, archiving, stopping, cloning, and analyzing performance. The following sections provide a brief overview of each operation.

## Filter Campaigns

You can use filters to quickly search your campaigns by Status, Channel, Time Period, creator, and more. To do so:

1. Go to _Messages_ > _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap dashboard. The _All Campaigns_ page opens.
2. Click the ![](https://files.readme.io/ac0ed6a-Filter_icon.png) icon. The _Filters_ window opens on the left side of the screen.

<Image align="center" alt="Filter Campaigns" border={true} caption="Filter Campaigns" src="https://files.readme.io/8cd9b547d48c83a96dd0269e92389e13d056f0c79334e187826806ab27e6d39a-listing.png" />

3. Select the required filters and click **Apply** to view results on the _All Campaigns_ page. If you create a filter and do not select **Apply**, the filter criteria are still displayed but not applied directly in the listing view. Filters are organized separately for Active and Archived campaigns.

   The following table covers the operations you can perform from the listing page:

   | Filter Section             | Options                                                                                      | Filter Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

4. Click **Reset** to reset all the applied filters.

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### Time Period Filters

  * By default, the **Time Period** filter for the **Started** and **Created** date is set to **All time**.
  * When viewing engagement metrics in the campaign list, the **Stats Period** filter is set to **Last 30** days by default.
  * Resetting reverts the Time Period filters to default values.
  * Date ranges saved in filters are relative to the current date. For example, a _past 2 days_ filter saved on July 2nd shows July 1st–2nd as the date range. When the same filter is applied on July 20th, it automatically shows July 19th–20th as the date range.
</Callout>

All filters except the _Delivery Type_ and _Segment Type_ filters also have individual reset options. You can reset a specific filter and click **Apply** to view the updated results in the campaign list immediately.

## Edit Columns

You can customize the campaign listing view to match your preferences. Click the _Edit Columns_ icon to select and reorder the columns you want to show on the campaign list page. You can view up to 2000 campaigns on the listing page.

The _Sent_ column is toggled off by default.

<Image align="center" alt="Edit Columns" border={true} caption="Edit Columns" src="https://files.readme.io/be3e0d05ae3e25119258ccd03b2cbf862937e840c4991064f92c2dbf0f0b1599-2025-12-11_18-40-00_1.gif" />

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### Note

  * The Campaigns listing page also displays the team each campaign is associated with. This feature is currently in Private Beta. For more information, refer to [Teams Setup](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/teams-setup).
  * Users can view and manage only the campaigns associated with their assigned teams. This ensures campaign visibility and actions align with the configured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
</Callout>

## Add Labels

Labels allow you to tag campaigns with descriptive names or themes. Once applied, labels enable you to group your various messaging campaigns, allowing you to view their performance or identify user behaviors. For example, you can create a label called _Onboarding_ to identify all the messaging campaigns (across all channels) related to onboarding your new users.

You can select up to 10 labels for a campaign. If a campaign already has more than 10 labels assigned from earlier configurations, they will still be visible under _Selected Labels_. However, in such cases, the user will not be able to select any additional labels.

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### Naming Labels

  The labels cannot start with or contain the following symbols: ”, , %, >, \<, and !.
</Callout>

You can create and apply labels from the _All Campaigns_ or the _All Journeys_ page. Labels can be applied to individual campaigns from the All Campaigns page during creation. To do so:

1. Go to _Messages_ > _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap dashboard. The _All Campaigns_ page opens.
2. Select the campaigns you may want to label and click the _Add Label_ icon.
3. Select the labels you want to add. These labels are moved to the _Selected Tag ID_ section. Click **Deselect** to remove any label.
4. Click **Apply**.

<Image align="center" alt="Create Multiple Message Labels" border={true} caption="Create and Assign Multiple Message Labels" src="https://files.readme.io/3dd944e95bec99bc93eba8c1d3a729042e52cc3085530098ae42ee79e531f8fa-2025-12-11_18-49-11_1.gif" />

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### Note

  * When applying labels in bulk, the selected labels are applied to _all_ selected campaigns. However, if you later select an individual campaign from that group, the bulk-applied labels do not automatically appear in the _Selected Tag ID_ section.
  * To view or manage the labels for a specific campaign, click the **Labels** icon next to the campaign.

  <Image align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/5ca549107a2598ece1d563f64e3d7e96bc164fa520e76bbe7ced774f45d0dbdd-labelsss.png" className="border" />
</Callout>

You can view and export all labels to a CSV file from the _Settings_ >  _Setup_  > _Labels_  page. You can also edit or delete labels from this page.

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### Note

  * Campaigns in Completed or Stopped state are automatically archived after 6 months. To view archived campaigns, click _Filters_ and select the _Archived_ filter.
  * Archived campaigns cannot be unarchived.
  * All archived campaigns (including drafts) are read‑only and cannot be published. To continue working on an archived campaign, clone it. The clone is treated as a new campaign. You can **Save as draft**, **Schedule**, or **Publish** the cloned campaign.
</Callout>

## Stop Campaigns

<Image align="center" alt={1422} border={true} caption="Filter Campaigns and View Campaign Reports" title="Filter Campaigns and view Campaign reports on CleverTap dashboard." src="https://files.readme.io/4179196a7509ec3d78977a0a4dee6e936edd8ae82e008a16a471d33cfbac1d64-2025-12-11_18-42-58.png" />

You can also email a report by selecting the campaign and clicking **Send Report** from the Campaign Reports window or by clicking the ![](https://files.readme.io/3baffd15a3c21d3330adf829d5e4fd8add811ad98f9b850f3e8ef2d3317f592b-reports_icon.png) icon from the campaign listing page.

If the report section opens with _All Time_ as the selected time period, requesting the report automatically adjusts the date range to ±15 days. A warning message is displayed to inform the user of this change. For more information, refer to [Campaign Reports](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/campaign-reports).

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### RBAC Enforcement for Campaign Operations

  The campaign listing page supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users can only perform actions that align with their assigned roles and team permissions. A user should first have access to the Campaigns or Journeys in general. From there, their channel-level permissions determine their role within each channel:

  * Read access: If users have read access to Push Campaigns, they can view content for all Push Campaigns.
  * Write access: If users have write access to certain Campaigns, they can create, edit, clone, publish, or delete content, but only for channels where they have been explicitly granted channel-level write access.

  For more information, refer to [Channel Level Access](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/role-based-access-control#channel-level-access).

  #### Access Behavior

  Refer to the following table for access behaviour. This applies to all actions across both Active and Archived campaigns.

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**             | Campaign is created but not yet published.                                              |
| **Scheduled**         | Campaign is set to go live at a future time.                                            |
| **Running**           | Campaign is currently live and executing.                                               |
| **Awaiting Next Run** | Recurring campaign has completed a run and is waiting for the next scheduled execution. |

**For Campaigns with Creator-Approver Workflow**

The following additional states apply only to campaigns created with the Creator-Approver workflow. These additional states help track the approval status of a campaign before it goes live.

| State                    | What it means                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pending for Approval** | Campaign is awaiting review and approval from the designated approver before it can be published or scheduled. |
