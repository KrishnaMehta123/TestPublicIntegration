## Overview

Consumers across the globe are increasingly shifting from phone calls, emails, and social media platforms to real-time messaging apps. They are turning to WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and other local apps to connect with family, friends, and colleagues. A similar experience is expected from brands to communicate with their users in real-time rather than waiting for responses from agents in call centers or passively communicating over emails.

## Use Cases

Engaging your end-users with chat-based conversations has a huge impact on your business metrics. The following table demonstrates some use cases:

| <p>Example Industry</p>       | <p>Use Cases</p>                                                                                                                                             |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p>Travel and Hospitality</p> | <ul><li>Transactional messages like bookings, refunds, cancelations </li><li>Reminders for upcoming flights or gate information on silent airports</li></ul> |
| <p>Food Delivery</p>          | <ul><li>Food delivery status, including information on driver and ETA</li><li>Thank you messages after order delivery</li></ul>                              |
| <p>Streaming Media/OTT</p>    | <ul><li>Premium service options when a user finishes a movie/episode</li></ul>                                                                               |

# Auto Responders

You can have a set of auto-responses to answer customer queries which can help relieve your agents and also significantly reduce the response time for the customer.

      "border": true,
      "caption": "Edit or Archive an FAQ"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### FAQ Types

You can create four types of FAQs to help distinguish your FAQs, such as:

- Greetings: Add a greeting such as hi, hello, good morning, and so on.
- General: Any conversation which is specific to your business need.
- Closing: Add an end to the conversation. For example, "Thank you for contacting us. Have a good day."
- Filler: Add a filler in the conversation. For example, "Please wait while I fetch your information."

> 📘 Adding a Question to an FAQ
> 
> When setting up an autoresponder, it is mandatory to add at least one question to the FAQ. Our NLP model (on which the responder is built) ensures that if similar questions are asked by your users, the autoresponder responds with the right answer.

## Set Up a Quick Reply

A quick reply can help you set the context for a conversation, generally during your non-business hours. To set up quick replies, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to _Conversations_ > _Setup_ > _Autoresponders_ > _Quick reply_. 
2. Click the **+ Reply** button to add quick replies. The Quick Reply page displays. 
3. Create a quick reply and select any of the time periods when the _Quick Reply_ must be active:  

- Always on
- During specific hours
- Between period

      "sizing": "100",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Setup a Quick Reply"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Always

The _Always_ quick reply triggers a specified response. It is triggered for all incoming messages, regardless of the time or day. It is ideal for providing immediate assistance or information to users without any time restrictions.

### During Specific Hours

The _During Specific Hours_ quick reply allows you to specify certain hours during which the predefined response should be triggered. It is useful for setting up responses that are relevant only during specific time periods, such as non-business hours support. You can even define hours on specific days such as 5.00 PM to 9.00 AM on Weekdays and all hours on Saturdays and Sundays. 

### Between Period

The _Between period_ quick reply triggers responses within specific time intervals or date ranges. It is suitable for creating responses that are relevant only during certain date ranges or recurring intervals, such as holidays.

## Prioritize

You can prioritize FAQs over quick replies and vice versa. To prioritize autoresponders, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to _Conversations_ > _Setup_ > _Autoresponders_. 
2. Select _FAQs_ and _Quick Reply_ from the list. The priority is set by the order of selection.

> 🚧 FAQ Responder Configuration
> 
> This flow assumes that the FAQ responder is configured first in the _Responders chain_ section.

## FAQ Best Practices

This section covers FAQ best practices, including:

1. Check that the questions are detailed and clear. Always use complete and meaningful sentences.  
   Example:

- Correct: How can I recover the password of my account? 
- Incorrect: Wrong password.

2. Add enough context to a question. Check that the answer contains all the relevant information for the user.  
   Example:

- Correct: How can I return my order?
- Incorrect: How to return?

3. Avoid having questions that have less than five words, however, it is okay to have short responses for closing, fillers, or greeting.  
   Example:

- Correct: Do you have COD as a payment option?
- Incorrect: COD please. 

4. Check that the FAQ sets are contextually exclusive from each other. 

5. Try to add related questions in the same FAQ to provide more context. The responder model can handle spelling errors as long as they do not affect the meaning of the sentence. Context and flow are more important than simple spelling errors or grammatical variations.

On the other hand, acronyms and lingos must be added in related questions separately.  
Example FAQ: Do you have cash on delivery as a payment option?

Related example questions:

- Do you have COD as a payment method?
- Can I pay after the delivery is completed?

6. The responder works best for the English language. Use of any other language for adding FAQs. For example, writing Hindi using Roman/Latin script may result in unpredictable performance. 

## Role Based Access: Agent Role

CleverTap has a system role of agents which gives the capability to dashboard users to access conversations. Apart from an agent, an admin can also access conversations. You can have multiple agents in the conversations dashboard.

> 📘 Agent Role
> 
> Agent role is a system role along with an admin, a member, a creator, and an approver. A user who is allocated an agent role will be able to access conversations.

To assign an agent role to a dashboard user, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to _Account_ > _Settings_ > _Users_. 
2. Select a user to assign an _Agent_ role. 

For more details on user role management, refer to [Role Based Access Control](doc:role-based-access-control).

If you are an authenticated user (Role = Admin or Agent), you can access conversations by clicking on _Conversations_ from the left navigation bar. 

> 🚧 One Agent per Conversation
> 
> It might happen that two or more agents click on the same conversation. In such cases, only the first agent can chat with the user and the agents who clicked later will not be able to chat.

The _Conversations_ dashboard looks like the following:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/78261b5-5_Conversations_dashboard.png",
        "Conversation Dashboard",
        "Conversation Dashboard"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Conversation Dashboard"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You see a list of conversations when you arrive on the dashboard. These conversations display when your end-users reply to one of your campaigns.

You can click any of the messages to open the chat window. The chat window is the panel that displays on the right where you can chat with your users seamlessly.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [

      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Respond to Conversations"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Unlike [WhatsApp](doc:whatsapp) campaigns where you have to use a templated messages, _Conversations_ lets you use free form messages and attach files.

## Converting User Queries into Customer Support Tickets

> 📘 Customer Support Ticketing
> 
> CleverTap provides putting a ticket status to ongoing chats with your end-users. This helps in categorizing and later searching based on the resolution status of your customer's queries.

You can assign one of the following five ticket statuses:

- New: As soon as a user replies to a campaign message, it is marked as _New_. This is irrespective of the previous ticket status with that user.
- Active: When an agent replies to the user.
- Pending: When the user replies back to the agent.
- Resolved: When the agent resolves the conversation.
- Inactive: These are all conversations that are past the 24-hour conversation. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/08ae725-5_Conversations_dashboard.png",
        "Ticketing in Conversations",
        1414
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "100",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Ticketing in Conversations"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> 📘 Inactive Conversations
> 
> The maximum limit for inactive conversations to appear in the inactive tab is 15.

Change Status  
An agent can move the status from one to the other. As shown in the following table, tickets auto change status based on these criteria:

| Flow                                      | Status   | Location                         |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------- |
| When user messages you for the first time | New      | All conversations                |
| When your agent replies back to the user  | Active   | My conversations (for the agent) |
| When user replies back to the agent       | Pending  | My conversations (for the agent) |
| When agent resolves the conversation      | Resolved | All conversation                 |
| When a 24-hour window expires             | Inactive | Inactive conversations           |

The ticket status is similar to a system profile property and hence, it is also searchable on the dashboard.

## Update Status Manually

To assign a ticket to a conversation, perform the following steps:

1. Cick on a conversation and close it. A pop-up displays asking you to assign a ticket before closing it.
2. Select a new ticket status.
3. Click **Assign and close**.

## Search and Sort Conversations

If you have millions of conversations going, CleverTap provides an easy way to search your conversations by clicking on the search bar on top of the conversations dashboard. 

The following filters are available:

- Search bar: Filters on user name, latest message text.
- Campaign: Filters based on campaign names.
- Label: Filters based on campaign labels.
- Ticket status: Filters based on ticket status.
