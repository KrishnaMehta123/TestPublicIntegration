# Overview

Scribe is the first and only AI-powered writing assistant that can also analyze and adjust the emotional tone of your content. Scribe communicates with the OpenAI APIs to generate messages for you. You can use a few text [prompts](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generate-message-copy-with-scribe) to automatically generate attractive and emotionally relevant messages. It removes writer's block, allowing you to create message copies effortlessly and add emotional appeal to them. Scribe also uses emojis and hashtags to generate appealing messages that help you drive engagement. 

> 📘 Note
> 
> Currently, this feature is only available for the **Push Notifications** and **Email **channel in Campaigns and Journeys.

To create a push notification message using Scribe:

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9686f87-ScribeFirst.jpg",

      ],

      "sizing": "90% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Create a Push Notification Message"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. On a Push Notification campaign, click the![](https://files.readme.io/0ef27a4-Magic_Wand.png) icon next to the _Title_ or _Message_ field on the message editor. 

The **Scribe** window displays.

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/0287977-image.png",
        null,
        "Scribe Window"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "90% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Scribe Window"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Enter your text in the _[Message/Prompt](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generate-message-copy-with-scribe)_ field and click any of the following buttons to
   - [Generate Copy](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/scribe#generate-copy): Generate multiple campaign copies with varying emotions based on the prompt you enter.
   - [Optimize for Emotions](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/scribe#optimize-for-emotions): Paraphrase and calibrate the emotional tone of the message.

> 📘 Note
> 
> The maximum character limit for the _Message/Prompt_ field is 250.

4. Click **[View sample prompts](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generate-message-copy-with-scribe)** if necessary. This will provide you with sample syntaxes for writing effective prompts.
5. To copy the generated content, hover over the message, click the ![](https://files.readme.io/f7f65dc-Copy_To_Clipboard.png)icon, click **Done** to exit the Scribe window, and paste the message. 

## Generate Copy

Based on the [prompt](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generate-message-copy-with-scribe) you enter, Scribe generates up to **three** message options. It also analyzes the content's emotional tone. For example, you can enter _Give me a message with 30% off on Smart TV for Black Friday Sale_. The message is evaluated for emotions such as Anticipation, Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), Joy, Surprise, and Trust. It enables you to understand how the audience may perceive the message. The emotional appeal of these messages can help you achieve a higher engagement. Based on the emotion analysis, you can select a message or click _Optimize for Emotions_ to further optimize the emotions. For more information about optimizing emotions, refer to [Optimize for Emotions](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/scribe#optimize-for-emotions).

        "Suggested Option and Emotion Analysis"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Suggested Option and Emotion Analysis"
    }
  ]
}

## Optimize for Emotions

Generates variations of the current messages and optimizes the emotional tone of the message variants. To do so:

1. Enter the message prompt and click **Generate Copy**.  Scribe displays the top three options on the screen, along with the emotional tone for each option. 
2. Select a particular option based on the emotion analysis and copy and paste it under the _Message Prompt_ field. 
3. Click **Optimize for Emotions** to suggest more options.
4. Use the **Increase** drop-down to increase a specific emotion for your target audience. 
5. Copy the message of your choice, hover over the message, click the ![](https://files.readme.io/dc61f0c-Copy_To_Clipboard.png)icon, click **Done** to exit the Scribe window, and paste the message.

For example, _Black Friday Sale Alert! Get a Smart TV with 30% off now! Don't miss out on this amazing deal!_ is the copy you want to optimize. If you want the message to evoke more _Joy_, it displays the top three messages with the highest _Joy_ element in descending order. You can use the _Optimize for Emotions_ feature again to generate more options.
