# Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to creating predictions within CleverTap. By following these instructions, users can set up predictions tailored to their business needs and enhance engagement strategies through data-driven insights.

# Start a System Prediction

Starting a system prediction in CleverTap is a quick and straightforward process. Follow the steps below to activate a prediction within a minute:

1. Navigate to *Predictions* from the CleverTap dashboard. The *Predictions* page opens.
2. From the list of available system predictions, hover over the prediction you want to start.
3. Click the ![](https://files.readme.io/431b58361bec0ba934b0e2e4cd2b6249cb6dba7654242c31ef96ad3ae0b13192-Ellipsis_Icon_Predictions.png) icon displayed against the prediction name and click **Start**.
4. Click **Next** > **Next** > **Setup** to start the prediction. 

The following example shows how to start the *Conversions* system prediction:

Once started, the system begins processing user data to generate prediction results. This may take some time, and the prediction activates once processing is complete.

# Create a Custom Prediction

The following are the key steps for creating any prediction:

1. Go to the *Predictions* section from the CleverTap dashboard.
2. Click *Create Prediction*. The *Create Custom Prediction* pop-up opens.
3. [Add Basic Details](doc:create-predictions#add-basic-details) and click **Next**.
4. [Set a Goal](doc:create-predictions#set-a-goal) and click **Next**.
5. Click **Add Rule** to [define the target audience](doc:create-predictions#define-a-target).
6. Click **Create**.

## Add Basic Details

The first step in creating a prediction is to provide key identifying information that will help you organize and manage your predictions efficiently. This information includes:

* **Prediction Name**: The name you assign to your prediction. Choose a clear, descriptive name for your prediction that allows you and your team to easily understand its purpose. **This name is going to appear as a custom User Property to indicate each user's Prediction Likelihood.**
* **Description**: A brief summary of the prediction's purpose and goals. The description offers additional context, outlining the prediction's objectives and highlighting any specific details that differentiate it from others. This is particularly useful when you have multiple predictions with similar goals but slight variations in filters or criteria.

## Set a Goal

Setting up a goal is a crucial step in the prediction process as it defines the specific outcome you want to anticipate. This involves the following two key components:

* **Select Goal Event**: The goal event is the specific user action that your prediction aims to anticipate. This action might include completing a purchase, signing up for a service, or reaching a milestone. By defining the goal event, you direct the prediction model to estimate the likelihood of users performing this action within the set timeframe. For example, in a travel booking app, a goal event might be Booked a Vacation Package, which tracks users who finalize their purchase of a vacation package. You can **add up to three goal events** for a Prediction.
* **Enter Prediction Period**: The prediction period specifies the time frame during which you expect the goal event to occur. This period provides context for your prediction, enabling you to plan and implement timely strategies. For instance, if the prediction period is set to *30 days*, the model will project which users are likely to book a vacation package within the next *30 days*. This helps you tailor your marketing efforts, such as offering targeted promotions or sending reminders, to drive user engagement during this period.

## Define a Target

The target segment determines which users the prediction model should analyze and for whom you want to set the Likelihood. This segment can be based on User Property, Behavior, or Interest. You can further define the target segment using filters such as their activity or purchase history to narrow down the audience. For example, you can target a segment of users who have viewed products but have not made a purchase in the last 30 days. 

<Image alt="Define a Target" align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/c895b90308b46a8013067790eb3a79e3a1e3f5e4c7585ae0dd8619b58e4b63c9-Define_a_Target.png">

By selecting this target group, you ensure that the prediction is focused on users who have shown interest but have not completed a purchase, predicting their likelihood to buy soon.

After creating a prediction, you will find it on the *Predictions* page. The system may take up to 24 hours to process user data and deliver actionable insights. 

> 📘 Active Prediction Limit
>
> You can have a maximum of **nine active predictions** at a time, including both System and Custom Predictions.

# Operations

You can perform a range of actions for your predictions directly from the *Predictions* page. Each of them is explained as follows:

## Search Prediction

You can search predictions by their *Name* from the *Predictions* page.

> 📘 Editing System Predictions
>
> CleverTap has specific limitations when editing System Predictions. You can not modify certain key details such as the **Target Segment**, **Name**, or **Description** for most system predictions. However, other options may vary by prediction type. Below are the editable and fixed fields for each system prediction:
>
> * **Conversion**: You can modify the **Goal** and **Prediction Period**.
> * **Retention**: Only the **Target Segment** can be edited.
> * **Uninstalls**: Only the **Target Segment** can be edited.
> * **New User Retention**: No fields can be edited for this prediction.
