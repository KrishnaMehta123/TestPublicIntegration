# Provide Feedback for Ask Responses

Ask is designed to provide accurate and helpful responses to your questions. To enhance its performance and accuracy, you can give feedback on the responses you receive. This feedback mechanism allows you to upvote or downvote responses, helping the knowledge bot improve continuously. Your input enhances accuracy, making Ask a better resource for CleverTap. Your feedback is essential in making Ask a valuable resource for the CleverTap community.

## Upvote

When you find a response particularly helpful, you can upvote it. This positive feedback signals Ask that the response was accurate and valuable. Upvoting encourages the system to prioritize similar responses in the future, making the information provided more reliable.

## Downvote

If a response is inaccurate or does not fully address your question, you can downvote it. Downvoting provides Ask with valuable feedback on areas that require improvement. The system will consider this feedback to refine its knowledge and provide more accurate responses over time.

# Best Practices

The following are the best practices for using Ask:

- **Prompt Effectively**: Formulate queries with clear and concise questions for the best results. Avoid vague or ambiguous queries. For example, instead of asking, "How to integrate CleverTap SDK?" you should ask, "How to integrate CleverTap Android SDK?" to ensure specificity and accuracy.
- **Interact with Ask**: Engage with Ask as you would in a regular chat, and do not hesitate to ask follow-up questions for deeper insights.

# Limitations

Be aware that Ask's responses are based on CleverTap's product documentation and blogs. While Ask strives to be accurate, it may have some limitations, especially during its beta phase. Always verify critical information from official sources whenever necessary.
