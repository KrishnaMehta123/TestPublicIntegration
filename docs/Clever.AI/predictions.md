In a world driven by user data, staying ahead is not just an advantage—it is a necessity. CleverTap’s Predictions feature **leverages advanced machine learning to forecast user actions**, enabling you to make strategic decisions that propel your engagement efforts and drive growth. Imagine you are a part of a marketing team gearing up for the Black Friday Sale. And, you want to identify the users who have the most likelihood of making a purchase. This is where Predictions come into play. Predictions **identify how likely your target segment is to perform a specific action within a defined time frame, enabling you to tailor your strategies for maximum impact**.

### Power of Predictions

Conventional campaign targeting typically involves creating a campaign for predefined target segments based on past behavior. Meanwhile, Predictions **analyze current and historical data to estimate the likelihood of specific future actions**. This allows you to target users more effectively by tailoring incentives and communication strategy while** maximizing marketing ROI** based on anticipated actions.

- **Increased Conversion Rates**: Predictive insights help you identify users who have a high likelihood to perform a particular action, allowing you to focus your efforts on moderate likelihoods and optimize your campaigns for better results.
- **Churn Management**: Understanding which users are at risk of churning enables you to proactively engage with them through personalized offers or interventions, thereby reducing churn rates.
- **Personalized User Experiences**: Predictions help you customize user experiences based on their likelihood to engage or convert, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Predictive analytics provide actionable insights based on historical data, enabling you to make informed decisions and strategize more effectively.
