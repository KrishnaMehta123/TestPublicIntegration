# Overview

Scribe is an AI-powered writing assistant that helps you generate engaging content and optimize its emotional tone. Scribe communicates with the OpenAI APIs to generate messages for you. You can use a few [text prompts](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generate-message-copy-with-scribe) to automatically generate attractive and emotionally relevant messages. It removes writer's block, allowing you to create message copies effortlessly and add emotional appeal to them. Scribe also uses emojis and hashtags wherever appropriate to generate appealing messages that help you drive engagement. 

# How Scribe Works

Scribe is available across Push, WhatsApp, Email, Web Push, and Content Blocks. You can access Scribe from your message editors to instantly generate or optimize text without leaving your workflow. Here is how to use it: 

1. Click the **Scribe** ![](https://files.readme.io/9ca89c5-Magic_Wand.png) icon next to the supported fields. The **Scribe** window opens, where you can generate or optimize your message content.
2. Enter your text in the *Message/Prompt* field and select any of the following options:
   * [Generate Copy](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/scribe#generate-copy): Generate multiple campaign copies with varying emotions based on the prompt you enter.
   * [Optimize for Emotions](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/scribe#optimize-for-emotions): Paraphrase and calibrate the emotional tone of the message.
3. Click **[View sample prompts](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generate-message-copy-with-scribe)** if necessary. This will provide you with sample syntaxes for writing effective prompts. 
4. Hover over the message and click the **Copy to clipboard** ![](https://files.readme.io/8a9e8dc-CopyToClipboard.png) icon to copy the generated content.

## Generate Copy

Based on the prompt you enter, Scribe generates up to three message options. It also analyzes the emotional tone of the content. For example, you can enter *Give me a message with 30% off on Smart TV for Black Friday Sale*. The message is evaluated for emotions such as Anticipation, Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), Joy, Surprise, and Trust. It enables you to understand how the audience may perceive the message. The emotional tone analysis helps you choose the message most likely to drive engagement. Based on the emotion analysis, you can select a message. 

You can also optimize the emotional tone of your generated message copy. For more information about optimizing emotions, refer to [Optimize for Emotions](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/scribe#optimize-for-emotions).

## Optimize for Emotions

After you generate different variations of the current message, copy the one that best aligns with your use case and brand tone. Paste the copied message into the *Message/Prompt* field, then click **Optimize for Emotions** to fine-tune the emotional tone of the selected message. Scribe displays up to ten options on the screen. Use the **Increase** drop-down to increase a specific emotion for your target audience. For example, enter the message *Black Friday Sale Alert! Get a Smart TV with 30% off now! Don't miss out on this amazing deal!* and click **Optimize For Emotions**. If you want the message to evoke more *Joy*, it displays the messages with the highest *Joy* emotion in descending order. You can click **Optimize for Emotions** again to generate more options.
