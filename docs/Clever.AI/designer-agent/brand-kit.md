# Overview

The **Brand Kit** helps ensure consistency across all generated assets, including copy and creative, and serves as a brand governance framework that defines your brand logos, colors, tone, and buttons. Once configured, these settings are automatically applied across AI tools (Designer and Copywriter agents), ensuring a unified branding experience in every campaign.

> 📘 Private Beta
>
> Currently, this feature is released in Private Beta. If you want to access this feature, contact your Customer Success Manager.

The following are the benefits of using a Brand Kit for your assets:

* Automatic application of brand-specific colors, typography, and button styles. 
* Consistent look and feel across all content and visuals.
* Faster approvals and campaign iterations. 
* Easy scaling of campaigns while preserving brand recognition.
* Smarter content reuse with Campaign Lookback, enabling AI to learn from past campaign language and styles.
* Reduced dependency on the Copy and Design teams, enabling faster campaign iterations.

> 📘 **Modifying Brand Kit**
>
> Any updates made to a Brand Kit apply automatically across AI Copywriter and Designer Agent once published.

# Accessing Brand Kit

You can access and manage Brand Kits from the Content Manager section of your account. Only users with CMS Brand Kit access can view or edit Brand Kits. Brand Kit permissions are managed through CMS role-based access control (RBAC) as follows:

| Role Type                                                 | Default Access | Description                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin                                                     | Read and Write | Full control to create, edit, clone, or delete Brand Kits. Changes apply across all AI tools once published.   |
| System Roles                                              | Read-only      | Can view Brand Kits but cannot edit or create new ones.                                                        |
| Custom Roles (for example, Content Manager, Content Head) | Configurable   | Access can be customized based on organizational needs. Admins can enable or restrict Create/Edit permissions. |

## Brand Kit Access in Teams

Team-based Brand Kit access is currently available in Private Beta and visible only to accounts with Teams enabled. For more information on how Teams works, refer to [Teams Setup](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/teams-setup).

      <td>
        Optional

      <td>
        When turned on, this prevents users from editing brand settings in campaign flows. Locking ensures brand consistency across global teams and eliminates off-brand variations.
      </td>

      <td>
        If you want every AI-generated image or content asset to strictly follow brand guidelines, you can lock the Brand Kit. Prompts that conflict with brand settings will automatically use the brand-defined option. For example, if your Brand Kit defines a red primary color and a user’s prompt requests a blue background, the AI will use red. Only admins can unlock or update a locked kit.

> 📘 **Brand Kit Precedence**
>
> When generating or editing images or content, the selected Brand Kit always takes precedence over text prompts. If a prompt conflicts with the Brand Kit’s settings (for example, color codes, borders, or tone), AI prioritizes the Brand Kit.
>
> For example, if your Brand Kit specifies a red border and the prompt requests a blue one, the generated image uses red, maintaining your brand consistency.

# Best Practices for Defining Brand Kit Guidelines

Use the Instructions field to clearly express what your brand stands for and how your content should feel. These guidelines enable the AI to select the appropriate tone, wording, and visual direction for all generated content.

> 📘 Note
>
> Content and Image Guidelines each have a 500-character limit.

Follow these best practices listed below when defining your Brand Kit guidelines:

* Define your core brand traits, such as trustworthy, friendly, premium, or bold, so the AI understands the tone to maintain.
* Specify how your brand communicates (simple, direct, conversational, formal, and so on), not exact copy examples.
* Explain the type of content your brand prefers, for example, informative, inspiring, actionable, playful, and so on.
* Clarify visual intent for images, such as mood, color direction, and overall feel (for example, clean, modern, high-contrast).
* Note any boundaries or must-avoid areas, including regulatory or compliance requirements.

## Sample Instructions

These are example instruction sets you can pre-fill in the Instructions field under *Content Guidelines* and *Image Guidelines* in the Brand Kit. This helps AI understand the preferred tone, style, and visual direction of the brand.

| Industry                         | Content Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                    | Image Guidelines                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consumer / Retail**            | “Use an active, conversational tone. Highlight benefits and promotions in clear, positive language. Avoid jargon and overpromising. Keep copy brief and easy to scan."                | “Use bright, engaging visuals with product focus. Maintain natural lighting and clean composition. Avoid overly dark or text-heavy designs.”                               |
| **Financial Services / Banking** | “Maintain a professional, confident tone. Use factual, non-exaggerated statements. Avoid words like ‘guaranteed’ or ‘risk-free.’ Ensure all messaging meets regulatory requirements.” | “Use trustworthy, calm visuals — clean design, corporate colors, and professional imagery. Avoid any visuals that may misrepresent returns, outcomes, or endorsements.”    |
| **Healthcare / Pharma**          | “Write in an empathetic, factual tone. Avoid making clinical claims or outcome promises. Ensure all messaging aligns with approved regulatory language.”                              | “Use clean, minimal visuals that focus on care and trust. Avoid imagery suggesting medical results or diagnoses. Prefer healthcare professionals and real people imagery.” |
| **Technology / SaaS / B2B**      | “Maintain a clear, formal tone. Use precise and informative statements that highlight value and reliability. Avoid hyperbolic or casual expressions.”                                 | “Use minimal, professional visuals with abstract or product-based graphics. Keep color palette brand-aligned and consistent. Avoid unlicensed or stock-heavy visuals.”     |
| **Food & Beverage**              | “Use friendly, appetizing language that highlights taste and quality. Avoid unrealistic or exaggerated claims like ‘best ever.’”                                                      | “Use warm, natural lighting and authentic food photography. Keep focus on product quality and freshness. Avoid overly edited or artificial looks.”                         |
| **Gaming / Entertainment**       | “Use an energetic, motivational tone. Highlight rewards or events with excitement, but avoid misleading outcome statements.”                                                          | “Use vibrant, high-contrast visuals with bold elements. Maintain consistent color palettes and avoid off-brand effects.”                                                   |
