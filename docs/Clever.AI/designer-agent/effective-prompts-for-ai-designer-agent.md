# Writing Effective Prompts

Writing a clear, focused prompt helps the AI Designer Agent understand what you want to create, why you are creating it, and where it will be used. A good prompt explains the intent of the campaign (what you want to achieve with this image), the visual feel, and the layout composition, ensuring the final design looks on-brand and aligns with your campaign goals.

You can follow this simple structure to describe your image idea in a way the Designer Agent understands easily:

### Define the Purpose (What the Image Is Meant to Do)

Start by defining the intent of the image. This gives the AI the foundation for your creative direction, whether it is a product launch, a discount banner, or a festive greeting. The agent uses this initial instruction to determine the type of image to create (such as product-focused, event-driven, or brand-awareness). For example, _"Create a promotional image announcing Diwali Sale on home décor items, offering up to 50% off."_

### Describe the Look and Feel (How the Image Should Feel)

Add details that capture your brand’s look and feel, mood, colors, and overall tone. Use adjectives that guide the image's lighting, energy, or emotional resonance. This helps the AI interpret the creative style accurately. For example, _“Use soft, festive lighting that evokes the spirit of Diwali celebrations.”_

### Add Layout and Composition (Where Key Elements Should Appear)

Specify the structure of your image, where to place text, logos, or visual emphasis. This provides the AI with guidance on framing and visual hierarchy, enhancing clarity and usability across all campaign channels. For example, _“Place the logo in the top-right corner.”_

### Combine All Three Parts

> Create a promotional image announcing HomeStay’s Diwali Sale on home décor items, offering up to 50% off. The image should instantly convey a festive, premium shopping experience and encourage users to click.
> Use soft, festive lighting that evokes the spirit of Diwali celebrations. The scene should evoke a sense of luxury and invitation.
> Include elegant home décor items, and the overall tone should be celebratory, warm, and of high quality. Place the HomeStay logo in the top-right corner. Display the featured décor items prominently in the center or foreground. Add a ‘Shop Now’ call-to-action button at the bottom of the image.

## **Prompt Tips**

The following are some useful tips when adding visual and emotional details to your prompts:

* Describe mood or emotion (for example, warm, premium, playful, trustworthy).
* Mention lighting or visual treatment (for example, soft light, gradient glow, high contrast).
* Be specific and describe what the image should show and why. Avoid short or vague inputs like “banner” or “sale.” For example: “Create a festive Diwali banner with gold lamps, warm lighting, and a red background.”
* Keep tone and brand cues consistent. Choose one style, for example, either “bold and expressive” or “clean and minimal.” Ensure color choices align with your Brand Kit. Avoid mixing contradictory styles (“vibrant and minimal”).
* Specify the text placement and exact text for the image, as the AI renders only the text stated in your prompt. Without text, AI may add placeholder content. For example: “Add the text ‘Shop Now’ at the bottom center in bold white.”
* Upload reference images directly instead of pasting URLs, as external links are not supported.

Add soft haze, lens flares, motion streaks, and a subtle red–blue split glow for energy. Keep the visual sharp, dramatic, and broadcast-grade with clear negative space at the top for text.
> Headline (top center): “Premier League Live”
> Subheadline: “Liverpool vs Chelsea • One Epic Battle.”

## FinTech

**Prompt:**

> Design a clean banner for a home loan offer in the FinTech domain.
> Use a calm, trustworthy color palette with blues, soft neutrals, and subtle gradients. Show a young couple or homeowner looking confident, secure, and financially empowered, with realistic, non-exaggerated expressions. Use modern FinTech styling with soft shadows, clean lines, and minimal icons.  
> CTA button at the bottom center, with rounded corners and solid blue fill, containing bold white text that reads “Apply Now”.  
> Headline: “Your Dream Home Awaits”
> Subtext: “Apply for low-interest home loans today.”

## Food Delivery

**Prompt:**

> Create a photorealistic festive banner for a dessert brand named "TreatsOn.” Show authentic Indian sweets such as barfi, laddoos, and jalebi arranged neatly on golden plates with marigold flowers and festive lights in the background.
> Use warm, celebratory colors like saffron, gold, and deep orange. The sweets should look fresh, real, and appetizing, as seen in professional food photography, not stylized or artificial. Add text clearly and prominently in the center-right area with high visibility:
> Headline: “Sweet Treats Incoming!”
> Subheadline: “Celebrate the Festival with TreatsOn.”
> Include the TreatsOn logo in the top-left corner for brand presence. Ensure text has ample contrast and focus, balanced equally with visuals. The overall layout should feel modern, premium, and festive, inspired by food delivery and quick-commerce brand campaigns.

**Result:**

  **How Brand Kit and Prompts Work Together**

  If your prompt conflicts with your Brand Kit, the Brand Kit always takes priority to maintain brand consistency. The system applies settings in this order: **Brand Kit → Prompt → Filters**

  This ensures every generated image stays brand-compliant and visually consistent with your defined design standards.
