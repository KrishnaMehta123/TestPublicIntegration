# Summary

On October 8, 2024, at approximately 10:00 PM PST, test emails were accidentally sent from our system to some of your CleverTap project users due to an internal testing activity. These emails originated from the email address: [segment-builder-feedback@clevertap.com](mailto:segment-builder-feedback@clevertap.com).

# Who received the email?

Only CleverTap project users who have logged in received the email.  
For example, if your app BuyRobots has a CleverTap project called _BuyRobots-prod_. This project can be accessed by three users, User1, User2, and User3.  Only User1, User2, and User3 received the test emails.
