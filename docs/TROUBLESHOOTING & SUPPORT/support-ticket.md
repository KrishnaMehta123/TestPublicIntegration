# Overview

If you encounter any questions or technical issues while using CleverTap, you can easily raise a Support Request with us. Before doing so, ensure you have explored the documentation available on our [Help Center](https://help.clevertap.com/hc/en-us). Additionally, we recommend utilizing [Ask](https://ask.clevertap.com/), our AI-assisted chatbot accessible from the Dashboard menu, to seek immediate assistance. Alternatively, CleverTap Enterprise customers can directly contact their dedicated Technical Account Manager (TAM) or Customer Success Manager (CSM).

To initiate and monitor support requests conveniently, you can utilize the CleverTap Dashboard. This allows you to track both ongoing and past tickets, ensuring a streamlined experience in addressing your concerns.

Furthermore, raising a support request from the dashboard automatically captures relevant account details. This enables our customer success team to efficiently assess, prioritize, and resolve issues. This feature is available to all customers.
