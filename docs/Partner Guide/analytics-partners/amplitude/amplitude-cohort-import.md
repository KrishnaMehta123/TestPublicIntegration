# Overview

[Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/), an analytics and business intelligence platform, helps make informed decisions for targeting users. This integration allows you to import cohorts (segments) from Amplitude into CleverTap and provides different benefits described in the below section.

# Key Benefits

Here are some of the key benefits of this integration:

* **Enhanced Cohort Management**: Leverage Amplitude's product analytics to create targeted cohorts (segments) in CleverTap for personalized messaging and engagement campaigns based on user behaviors and preferences captured in Amplitude.
* **Comprehensive Event Tracking**: Capture and analyze user interactions within CleverTap, such as app installs, uninstallations, push notifications, and in-app messages, in Amplitude for a holistic view of user engagement across both platforms.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Make informed decisions and optimize your customer engagement strategies by leveraging the combined insights from CleverTap and Amplitude's powerful analytics engines.
* **Personalized and Relevant Campaigns**: Deliver contextual and personalized messaging to your users based on their behaviors and preferences captured in Amplitude, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.
* **Streamlined Workflow**: Seamlessly push cohorts (segments) and system events between CleverTap and Amplitude with a simple and intuitive setup, saving you time and effort in managing your marketing campaigns.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin the integration, ensure that you have:

* Correctly map the Amplitude Cohorts (segments) to CleverTap Segments
* The required permission to create cohorts (segments) in the Amplitude account

# Set Up

This procedure involves the following four major steps:

1. [Map User Identities for Amplitude Cohorts to CleverTap Segments](doc:amplitude-cohort-import#map-user-identities-for-amplitude-cohorts-to-clevertap-segments)
2. [Find CleverTap Project Details](doc:amplitude-cohort-import#find-clevertap-project-details)
3. [Configure CleverTap as a Destination in Amplitude](doc:amplitude-cohort-import#configure-clevertap-integration-in-amplitude)
4. [Import Cohorts from Amplitude](doc:amplitude-cohort-import#import-cohorts-from-amplitude)

## Map User Identities for Amplitude Cohorts to CleverTap Segments

Amplitude exports all users to CleverTap, including anonymous users. A common identifier is used to match users when syncing cohorts (segments) from Amplitude to CleverTap. The following are the key points to remember when setting up an identifier on the Amplitude dashboard:

* Amplitude captures `User ID` and `Device ID` as an identifier for every profile. The `User ID` is for identified profiles, whereas the `Device ID` is for every profile.
* CleverTap allows `identity`, `email` or `phone` as an identifier for the users. It captures `Device ID` as the CleverTap ID (Object ID) for every profile.

For more information about how users are identified, refer to the following section.

### User Identity Management

The CleverTap User ID is a unique identifier assigned to the user in Amplitude. This identifier enables the mapping of user data between CleverTap and Amplitude, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior and engagement across different channels. When importing cohorts (segments) from Amplitude, the user identity is matched in the following manner:

* If the CleverTap User ID is present in Amplitude, it is matched with the identity value of all the users present in CleverTap. If a match is found, the profile becomes part of the segment.
* If the CleverTap User ID is not present in Amplitude, the Device Id (Anonymous Id) value is used as CleverTap ID, and a new profile is created in CleverTap. This new profile becomes part of the segment.

To understand this better, refer to the following diagram:

<Image align="center" alt="User Identity Mapping When Importing Cohorts (segments) to CleverTap" border={true} caption="User Identity Mapping When Importing Cohorts (segments) to CleverTap" src="https://files.readme.io/2299ef2-Amplitude_User_Identity_Mapping.png" />

To understand how users are identified in different scenarios, read the following information:

**Scenario 1: When a user's identity is the same in both Amplitude and CleverTap**

Consider a scenario where user A is assigned the CleverTap User ID `Clevertap1` in Amplitude, and the same user's identity is set as `clevertap1` in CleverTap.

In this scenario, CleverTap raises a _Partner Sync_ event for the user in CleverTap and includes the user in the segment (cohort).

**Scenario 2: When a user's identity is different in Amplitude and CleverTap**

Consider a scenario where user A is assigned the CleverTap User ID `CleverTap1` in Amplitude, and the same user is identified with a different user identity in CleverTap, which is `CleverTap2`.

In this case, the CleverTap creates a new profile for the same user with a new identity as `CleverTap1` and raises a _Partner Sync_ event to include the new profile in the segment (cohort).

To avoid this scenario, CleverTap recommends you push the _CleverTap_Identity_ as the identity in Amplitude and use this identity when setting up CleverTap as a cohort (segment) destination. For more information, refer to [Set Up Common User Identifier](doc:amplitude-cohort-import#set-up-common-user-identifier-between-clevertap-and-amplitude).

**Scenario 3: When User A with Device ID is not identified in Amplitude**

Consider a scenario where a user with Device ID `543C-3455-4555-3SRD` is not identified in Amplitude. In this scenario, CleverTap captures this Device ID (`543C-3455-4555-3SRD`) as CleverTap ID (Object ID) and creates a new profile. After the new profile is created, CleverTap raises a _Partner Sync_ event for this profile and includes the user in the segment (cohort).

### Set Up Common User Identifier between CleverTap and Amplitude

When a user's identity differs between Amplitude and CleverTap, the common user identifier must be set up to identify and include the user in the cohort (segment). The following are two different ways of setting up a common identifier between the two platforms:

#### Using Amplitude APIs

The value that is passed in `CleverTap_Identity` must be the same as that passed as identity in CleverTap.

```curl
curl --location --request POST 'https://api2.amplitude.com/identify' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'api_key=a0ccac7656a6e187b597f44476dd031e' \
--data-urlencode 'identification=[{"user_id":"amplitude_id", "user_properties":{"CleverTap_Identity":"integrations@clevertap.com"}}]'

```

> 📘 Set Up Identity
>
> You must replace the value of `CleverTap_Identity` with the user identity value set in CleverTap for the profile. For example, `integrations@clevertap.com` is the identity set in CleverTap, so we must pass that value to Amplitude. If the value of the identity was `12345`, we must pass the value as `12345`.

#### Using Amplitude SDKs

The value that is passed in `CleverTap_user_Id` must be the same as that passed in CleverTap.

```java
val identify = Identify()  
identify.set("CleverTap_Identity", "integrations@clevertap.com")  
amplitude.identify(identify)
```
```objectivec
AMPIdentify *identify = [[[AMPIdentify identify] set:@"CleverTap_Identity" value:@"[integrations@clevertap.com]]];  
[[Amplitude instance] identify:identify];
```
```swift
let identify = AMPIdentify()  
.set("CleverTap_Identity", value: "integrations@clevertap.com")  
Amplitude.instance().identify(identify)
```
