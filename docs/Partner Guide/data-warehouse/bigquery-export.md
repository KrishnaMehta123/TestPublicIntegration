## Store the Data in BigQuery

Suppose you have an e-commerce website, and you want to store and analyze your CleverTap data of *Notification Sent* events using BigQuery. To achieve this use case, you need to create the following:

* [Datasets](doc:bigquery#datasets)
* [Tables](doc:bigquery#tables)

### Datasets

To store the data in BigQuery, you must first create a [dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro). Consider a dataset as a folder containing tables, views, and other BigQuery objects. For our use case, let's create a dataset called *CleverTap\_Data*. This dataset will act as a container to organize and manage all the tables and information related to CleverTap data.

To create a dataset in BigQuery:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your project or create a new project if required.
3. From the navigation menu on the left, click **BigQuery** to access the BigQuery Console.
4. Choose a Project. If you have multiple projects, ensure you select the correct project where you want to create the dataset.
5. Click the![](https://files.readme.io/b927780-Ellipsis_Bigquery_1.png) icon from your project name and click **Create dataset** from the context menu.
6. In the *Create Dataset* dialog box, enter a unique name for your dataset. Choose a name that conveys the purpose or content of the data you will store within it.
7. Select the location for your dataset. It determines the geographical region where the data will be physically stored. Choose a location that aligns with your data residency requirements.
8. Click **Create dataset**.

For more information, refer to [Create Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets).

### Tables

Let us consider [tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables-intro) as spreadsheets within the *CleverTap\_Data* dataset. Each table consists of columns (similar to columns in a spreadsheet) that define the specific data fields you want to capture. For example, the *user\_id*, *event\_name*, *campaign\_name* and *campaign\_id*.

Once you have created a dataset in BigQuery, you can create tables within that dataset to store your data. Creating tables in BigQuery enables you to structure and store your data for efficient analysis and querying. By defining the table schema and optionally loading data, you can effectively organize your datasets and leverage the power of BigQuery for data analytics and exploration.

By creating these tables within the *CleverTap\_Data* dataset, you can easily organize and analyze your customer data. You can run queries to extract insights, perform calculations, and generate reports based on the information stored in these tables.

To create a table in BigQuery:

1. Locate and click the dataset name where you want to create the table in the BigQuery console. The dataset will expand to display its contents.
2. Click the **Create table** button or the ellipsis icon![](https://files.readme.io/d7ba75b-Ellipsis_Bigquery_1.png)on dataset name and click **Create table** from the context menu. This will open the table creation form.
3. Configure the below Table Settings:
   1. From *Source*, select **Google Cloud Service** in the *Create table form* field.
   2. Browse your GCS bucket and choose the *Notification Sent* file to transfer its data.
   3. Select **CSV** in the *File format* option.
   4. From *Destination*, select the *Project* and *Dataset* where you want to transfer the data.
   5. Provide a unique name for your table in the *Table* field. We recommend you choose a descriptive name that reflects the purpose or content of the table. This helps you to identify the event data that you will transfer to the table. For this example, enter the table name as **Notification Sent**, which means that every event export file with the name *Notification Sent* will append to this table.
   6. Select the *Table type* as **Native table** to store data from your Google Cloud Storage bucket.
4. Click **Create table**.

<Image alt="Create a Table" align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/8a0de62-Create_Table.gif">

</Image>

Once the table is created, you can view and manage it within the dataset. The table will be listed along with any other existing tables in the dataset. From the table view, you can perform operations such as running queries, modifying the table schema, setting access controls, and managing table properties. You can also configure table-specific settings, such as expiration policies, which automatically delete the table or its partitions after a specific time period. For more information, refer to [Create Tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables).

> 📘 Note
>
> In the above use case, the dataset *CleverTap\_Data* acts as a container or folder, while the table *Notification Sent* acts as individual tables, each storing specific types of information related to customer data.

## Verify the Incoming Data

Before you configure the Data Transfer, you need to verify if your data has been correctly loaded and that the schema is in place. To verify the incoming data:

1. Navigate to the *Explorer* dashboard.
2. Click the table in the sidebar. The *SCHEMA* page opens:

<Image alt="View Schema" align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/3a15bfa-Schema.png">

## Set Up a Recurring Data Transfer Service

Finally, set up a recurring data transfer service to move the exported data from GCS to BigQuery. The Data Transfer setup transfers the data from GCS to BigQuery. Create a [Cloud Storage Transfer](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/cloud-storage-transfer) from BigQuery that triggers a data transfer pipeline at the same interval as the export file. For example,  every 4 hours).

To set up a recurring data transfer service: 

1. Navigate to *BigQuery* > *Data Transfer* from the Google Cloud console.
2. Click **Create Transfer**.
3. On the *Create Transfer* page:

* In the *Source type* section, from *Source* drop-down, select *Google Cloud Storage*.

* In the *Data source details* section:
  * In the *Destination table* field, enter the table name you created to store the data in BigQuery.
  * In the *Cloud Storage URI* field, browse the *Notification\_Sent* event from the bucket.
    > 📘 Naming Convention
    >
    > When using the Cloud Storage URI to browse for event data, include an asterisk (\*) before and after the event name as shown in the image below. This allows the event export table to continuously update with fresh event data.
  * From the *Write preference* drop-down, select *APPEND*, to append new data to your existing destination table. The default value for *Write preference* is *APPEND*.
  * Check the *Delete source files after transfer* option to delete the source files from the GCS bucket after they are transferred to the BigQuery table. This helps to optimize the cloud storage cost.
  * From the *File format* drop-down, select the data format you selected while exporting the data from the CleverTap dashboard. We recommend you select the file format as CSV.
