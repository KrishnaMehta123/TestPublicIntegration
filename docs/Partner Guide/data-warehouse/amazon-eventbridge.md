# Overview

CleverTap now enables you to send events to the [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) ecosystem. Events can flow from CleverTap via Amazon EventBridge to various other services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, Redshift, Firehose and Amazon Kinesis streams.

Once integrated with Amazon EventBridge, you can send the CleverTap events into any service in your AWS account.

# Pre-requisites

  * AWS account ID
  * AWS region to be associated to

# Integrate EventBridge with CleverTap

This process involves the following three steps:

1. [Find Amazon EventBridge Event Source Details](doc:amazon-eventbridge#find-amazon-eventbridge-event-source-details).
2. [Configure CleverTap Event Source](doc:amazon-eventbridge#configure-clevertap-event-source).
3. [Associate Event Source with Designated Event Bus in AWS Console](doc:amazon-eventbridge#associate-event-source-with-designated-event-bus-in-aws-console).

## Find Amazon EventBridge Event Source Details

To find the event source details:

1. Navigate to Amazon EventBridge Partners from the Amazon EventBridge dashboard.
2. Click **Set up** under the CleverTap partner listing. The *Set up event source* page opens.
3. Click **Copy** to copy your AWS account number to your clipboard and save it. You will require these details for configuring the CleverTap dashboard.

## Configure CleverTap Event Source

To configure CleverTap Event Source:

## Associate Event Source with Designated Event Bus in AWS Console

To establish an event connection to Amazon EventBridge, your CleverTap event source must be associated with the event bus in Amazon EventBridge. You can now see the CleverTap event source, created in *Step 3* of [Configure CleverTap Event Source](doc:amazon-eventbridge#configure-clevertap-event-source), under the *Partner* events sources on the Amazon EventBridge dashboard. To associate the event source with the designated event bus in the AWS console:

1. Select the event source name and associate it with an event bus. 
2. After establishing the connection, set your rules and targets for Amazon EventBridge to redirect events to an AWS service. For more information, refer to the [Amazon EventBridge documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/index.html).
