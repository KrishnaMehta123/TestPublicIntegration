## Store the Data in BigQuery

Suppose you have an e-commerce website, and you want to store and analyze your CleverTap data of _Notification Sent_ events using BigQuery. To achieve this use case, you need to create the following:

- [Datasets](doc:bigquery#datasets)
- [Tables](doc:bigquery#tables)

### Datasets

To store the data in BigQuery, you must first create a [dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro). Consider a dataset as a folder containing tables, views, and other BigQuery objects. For our use case, let's create a dataset called _CleverTap_Data_. This dataset will act as a container to organize and manage all the tables and information related to CleverTap data.

To create a dataset in BigQuery:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your project or create a new project if required.
3. From the navigation menu on the left, click **BigQuery** to access the BigQuery Console.
4. Choose a Project. If you have multiple projects, ensure you select the correct project where you want to create the dataset.
5. Click the![](https://files.readme.io/b927780-Ellipsis_Bigquery_1.png) icon from your project name and click **Create dataset** from the context menu.
6. In the _Create Dataset_ dialog box, enter a unique name for your dataset. Choose a name that conveys the purpose or content of the data you will store within it.
7. Select the location for your dataset. It determines the geographical region where the data will be physically stored. Choose a location that aligns with your data residency requirements.
8. Click **Create dataset**.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/800803e-Create_Dataset_CleverTap_Data.gif",
        null,
        "Create a Dataset"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Create a Dataset"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


For more information, refer to [Create Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets).

### Tables

Let us consider [tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables-intro) as spreadsheets within the _CleverTap_Data_ dataset. Each table consists of columns (similar to columns in a spreadsheet) that define the specific data fields you want to capture. For example, the _user_id_, _event_name_, _campaign_name_ and _campaign_id_.

Once you have created a dataset in BigQuery, you can create tables within that dataset to store your data. Creating tables in BigQuery enables you to structure and store your data for efficient analysis and querying. By defining the table schema and optionally loading data, you can effectively organize your datasets and leverage the power of BigQuery for data analytics and exploration.

By creating these tables within the _CleverTap_Data_ dataset, you can easily organize and analyze your customer data. You can run queries to extract insights, perform calculations, and generate reports based on the information stored in these tables.

To create a table in BigQuery:

1. Locate and click the dataset name where you want to create the table in the BigQuery console. The dataset will expand to display its contents.
2. Click the **Create table** button or the ellipsis icon![](https://files.readme.io/d7ba75b-Ellipsis_Bigquery_1.png)on dataset name and click **Create table** from the context menu. This will open the table creation form.
3. Configure the below Table Settings:
   1. From _Source_, select **Google Cloud Service** in the _Create table form_ field.
   2. Browse your GCS bucket and choose the _Notification Sent_ file to transfer its data.
   3. Select **CSV** in the _File format_ option.
   4. From _Destination_, select the _Project_ and _Dataset_ where you want to transfer the data.
   5. Provide a unique name for your table in the _Table_ field. We recommend you choose a descriptive name that reflects the purpose or content of the table. This helps you to identify the event data that you will transfer to the table. For this example, enter the table name as **Notification Sent**, which means that every event export file with the name _Notification Sent_ will append to this table.
   6. Select the _Table type_ as **Native table** to store data from your Google Cloud Storage bucket.
4. Click **Create table**.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/8a0de62-Create_Table.gif",
        null,
        "Create a Table"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Create a Table"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Once the table is created, you can view and manage it within the dataset. The table will be listed along with any other existing tables in the dataset. From the table view, you can perform operations such as running queries, modifying the table schema, setting access controls, and managing table properties. You can also configure table-specific settings, such as expiration policies, which automatically delete the table or its partitions after a specific time period. For more information, refer to [Create Tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables).

> 📘 Note
> 
> In the above use case, the dataset _CleverTap_Data_ acts as a container or folder, while the table _Notification Sent_ acts as individual tables, each storing specific types of information related to customer data.

## Verify the Incoming Data

Before you configure the Data Transfer, you need to verify if your data has been correctly loaded and that the schema is in place. To verify the incoming data:

1. Navigate to the _Explorer_ dashboard.
2. Click the table in the sidebar. The _SCHEMA_ page opens:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/3a15bfa-Schema.png",
        null,
        "View Schema"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "View Schema"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Click the **PREVIEW** tab to verify the incoming data.

        null,
        "Preview the Incoming Data"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Preview the Incoming Data"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Set Up a Recurring Data Transfer Service

Finally, set up a recurring data transfer service to move the exported data from GCS to BigQuery. The Data Transfer setup transfers the data from GCS to BigQuery. Create a [Cloud Storage Transfer](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/cloud-storage-transfer) from BigQuery that triggers a data transfer pipeline at the same interval as the export file. For example,  every 4 hours).

To set up a recurring data transfer service: 

1. Navigate to _BigQuery_ > _Data Transfer_ from the Google Cloud console.
2. Click **Create Transfer**.
3. On the _Create Transfer_ page:

- In the _Source type_ section, from _Source_ drop-down, select _Google Cloud Storage_.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/588d34e-Source_Type_Bigquery.png",
        null,
        "Source Type"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Source Type"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- In the _Transfer config name_ field, from the _Display name_, enter a name for the transfer, such as _Notification_Sent_Data_. The transfer name can be any value that allows you to easily identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a2626c1-Transfer_config_name.png",
        null,
        "Transfer Config Name"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Transfer Config Name"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- In the _Schedule options_ section, set the _Repeat frequencies_ for the schedule. You may either choose the default value as **Start now** to schedule the export immediately or click **Start at a set time** to schedule the export at a later time.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/62a5084-Schedule_Options.png",
        null,
        "Schedule Options"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Schedule Options"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- In the _Destination settings_ section, from the _Destination dataset_ drop-down, choose the dataset you created to store your data.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/1da5024-Dataset_Name.png",
        null,
        "Destination Settings"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Destination Settings"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- In the _Data source details_ section:
  - In the _Destination table_ field, enter the table name you created to store the data in BigQuery.
  - In the _Cloud Storage URI_ field, browse the _Notification_Sent_ event from the bucket.
    > 📘 Naming Convention
    > 
    > When using the Cloud Storage URI to browse for event data, include an asterisk (\*) before and after the event name as shown in the image below. This allows the event export table to continuously update with fresh event data.
  - From the _Write preference_ drop-down, select _APPEND_, to append new data to your existing destination table. The default value for _Write preference_ is _APPEND_.
  - Check the _Delete source files after transfer_ option to delete the source files from the GCS bucket after they are transferred to the BigQuery table. This helps to optimize the cloud storage cost.
  - From the _File format_ drop-down, select the data format you selected while exporting the data from the CleverTap dashboard. We recommend you select the file format as CSV.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2084205-Data_Source_Details.png",
        null,
        "Data Source Details"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Data Source Details"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- In the _Header rows to skip_ field, we suggest entering at least one row corresponding to the table titles. This ensures that the space for table titles is preserved when transferring the data to the table.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ad59ab4-Header_Rows_to_Skip.png",
        null,
        "Header Rows to Skip"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Header Rows to Skip"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Click **Save**.
