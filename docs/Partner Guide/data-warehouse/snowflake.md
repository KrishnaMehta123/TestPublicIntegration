# Set Up Snowflake for Integration

You can set up Snowflake using one of the following ways:

* For new users who need to provision Snowflake resources from scratch: [Create a new Database, Warehouse, Role, Schema, and User](doc:snowflake#create-role).
* For users who already have configured resources in Snowflake: [Use Existing Snowflake Credentials](doc:snowflake#use-existing-snowflake-credentials)

## Create New Snowflake Setup

If you do not already have a Database, Warehouse, Role, Schema, and User configured in Snowflake, you must create them before proceeding. These components are required to ensure CleverTap can securely access, store, and process your data.

To create each resource, perform the following steps:

1. [Create a Database](doc:snowflake#create-database)
2. [Create a Warehouse](doc:snowflake#create-warehouse)
3. [Create a Role](doc:snowflake#create-role)
4. [Create a Schema ](doc:snowflake#create-schema): Mandatory for exporting data and optional for importing data.
5. [Create a User](doc:snowflake#create-user)

### Create Database

To get your Snowflake data in CleverTap, you first need to create a database. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Snowflake account and open a new SQL worksheet.
2. Run the following SQL command to create a database:

   ```sql SQL
   -- Create a new database for CleverTap data storage
   CREATE DATABASE CLEVERTAP_DB;

   -- Verify database creation
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

### Create Warehouse

To avoid conflicts with other operations in your cluster, CleverTap recommends creating a new warehouse specifically for CleverTap loads. An X-Small warehouse is large enough for most CleverTap customers when they first configure their Snowflake.

Run the following command to create a warehouse:

```sql
-- Create a warehouse for query execution

CREATE WAREHOUSE CLEVERTAP_WH WITH  

WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'  

AUTO_SUSPEND = 600  

AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

-- Verify warehouse creation

SHOW WAREHOUSES;
```

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### Note

  To avoid extra costs, set `AUTO_SUSPEND` to ~10 minutes on the Snowflake dashboard (or 600 if using SQL) and enable `AUTO_RESUME`.  This ensures efficient usage since Snowflake charges on a [per-second billing model](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations#automating-warehouse-suspension).
</Callout>

### Create Schema

After creating the database, you must create a schema to organize CleverTap-related objects. This step is required only to export data from CleverTap to Snowflake. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure you are using the correct database context:

   ```sql SQL
   -- Switch to the CleverTap database
   USE DATABASE CLEVERTAP_DB;
   ```

2. Execute the following SQL command to create a schema:

   ```sql SQL
   -- Create a new schema for CleverTap data
   CREATE SCHEMA ClEVERTAP_SCHEMA;

   -- Verify schema creation
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE CLEVERTAP_DB;
   ```

### Create Role

To ensure proper access control, assign a role specifically for CleverTap integration:

1. Create a role for CleverTap integration:
   ```sql SQL
   CREATE ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   ```
2. Grant necessary privileges as follows
   * **Using Public Schema**:
   ```sql SQL
   -- Grant required privileges
   GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE CLEVERTAP_DB TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE CLEVERTAP_WH TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA CLEVERTAP_DB.PUBLIC TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA CLEVERTAP_DB.PUBLIC TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA CLEVERTAP_DB.PUBLIC TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   ```
   * **Using Other Schema**:  
     If you are using the `PUBLIC` schema, the permission listed above is sufficient.  
     However, if you are using a custom schema, replace the`<schema name>` with the actual schema name and grant the following privileges:
   ```sql
   -- Grant required privileges
   GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE CLEVERTAP_DB TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE CLEVERTAP_WH TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA CLEVERTAP_DB.<schema_name> TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA CLEVERTAP_DB.<schema name> TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA CLEVERTAP_DB.<schema name> TO ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE;
   ```

### Create User

To manage access securely, create a dedicated user for the CleverTap configuration by executing the following SQL query:

```sql

-- Create a dedicated user for CleverTap integration

CREATE USER CleverTap_USER WITH DEFAULT_ROLE = CLEVERTAP_ROLE DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = CLEVERTAP_WH;

-- Grant the role to the user

GRANT ROLE CLEVERTAP_ROLE TO USER ClEVERTAP_USER;
```

<br />

## Use Existing Snowflake Credentials

If you already have Snowflake set up, perform the following steps to find each detail on the Snowflake dashboard.

* [Obtain Your Snowflake Account Identifier](doc:snowflake#obtain-your-snowflake-account-identifier)
* [Find Existing Database](doc:snowflake#find-existing-database)
* [Find Existing Warehouse](doc:snowflake#find-existing-warehouse)
* [Find and Assign Existing Role](doc:snowflake#find-and-assign-existing-role)
* [Find Existing Schema](doc:snowflake#find-existing-schema) (for exports)

1. Log in to Snowflake and go to _Admin_ > _Users & Roles_.
2. Select the **Users** tab to view all users.
3. Select the CleverTap user and go to the _Privileges_ section.
4. Check the assigned roles and update if necessary using the following SQL command:

```sql
GRANT ROLE clevertap_role TO USER clevertap_user;
```

### Find Existing Schema

To find existing schemas in a specific database that are needed for CleverTap exports, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to Snowflake and open the **Snowflake Web UI**.
2. Select the **Databases** tab on the left panel and select the desired database.
3. Select the **Schemas** tab to view all available schemas within that database.
4. Alternatively, run the following SQL command to retrieve the schema names:

## User Details

Provide the **Username** and generate the **Key** during setup in the CleverTap dashboard.

### Key Pair Authentication

To generate a Key for Key Pair Authentication, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Key** as your authentication method.
2. Click **Generate Key** to display the public key.
3. Add this public key to your Snowflake database user using the following SQL command:
   <br />
   ```sql
   ALTER USER ClEVERTAP_USER SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='MIIBIjANBgkqh...';
   ```
   <br />
4. (Optional) Rotate keys using CleverTap's **Regenerate Key** option if your IT policies require periodic key changes. Using the _Edit_ option, go to the same section and click **Regenerate Key** on the CleverTap dashboard. Attach the newly generated public key to your Snowflake database user as an additional RSA key. For more information about this, refer to [Snowflake Key Rotation document](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-rotation).

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  #### Saving Regenerated Key

  * Once you save the connection with the new key, the previous key will no longer be used.
  * If you generate a new key but close the edit form without saving, CleverTap will continue using the existing key, and the newly generated key will be deleted.
  * If the new key is not attached to the Snowflake user before saving, imports and exports may fail.
  * For detailed guidance on setting up and managing key pair authentication in Snowflake, refer to [Snowflake’s Key Pair Authentication Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html).

<Image align="center" border={true} caption="Generate Key" src="https://files.readme.io/565fd2e94eeaea795ae6e8252fffe0b4f5bdaebba53ad862ac52ced3f67c0da9-User_Credentials.png" />

5. Click **Test Connection** or **Save** to start the import or export after adding the details:
   * **Test Connection**: Verifies if the database credentials and setup are correct. A successful test confirms the connection, while a failure prompts you to review your settings.
   * **Save**: Saves the connection details, enabling you to proceed with the data import or export process.

# FAQs

### How can I delete a connection that has running imports?

Go to _Import Connections_, select the connection, click _Delete_, review the list of running imports, and confirm **Delete**.  This will stop all running imports before deleting the connection.

### How can I filter import connections?

Use the **Filter** option on _Import Connections_ to refine displayed databases:

* **Connected On**: Select a date range to view connections created within that timeframe.
* **Connected By**: Filter by email IDs of users who created the connections.

### How can I whitelist IPs for CleverTap integration?
