# Overview

CleverTap allows you to export data to third-party partners, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), etc. You have the flexibility to choose between one-time data exports and recurring exports. Keeping track of export status is crucial, especially for recurring exports, as they are scheduled to run at regular intervals.

This feature allows you to monitor the status of your data exports via Webhook on your preferred systems. It provides alerts when an export is initiated or completed successfully. Status tracking allows for keeping track of your recurring exports and taking necessary decisions whenever required.
