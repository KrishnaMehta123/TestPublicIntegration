# WhatsApp Integration via CleverTap

CleverTap offers direct access to the **WhatsApp Business API** right from its dashboard, with no third-party setup required.

Besides, if you already have access to the WhatsApp Business API via third-party providers such as **Exotel**, **Gupshup**, **Nexmo**, and others, you can configure these providers directly within the CleverTap dashboard to use WhatsApp as a communication channel through them.

To get started with WhatsApp, please contact [sales@clevertap.com](mailto:sales@clevertap.com).
