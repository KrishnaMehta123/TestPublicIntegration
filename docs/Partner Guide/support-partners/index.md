This integration allows customers to automatically create support tickets in their [Zendesk](doc:zendesk) account when users share negative feedback on NPS surveys. By connecting Zendesk with CleverTap, customer support teams can capture feedback in real time and convert it into actionable support tickets without manual intervention.

Tickets can be created when users submit negative feedback through Rating In-app campaigns, SMS, Email, or any other supported CleverTap campaign. This ensures that critical customer issues are promptly routed to the support team, enabling faster follow-ups, improved resolution times, and a more responsive customer support experience.

The integration helps bridge customer engagement and customer support by ensuring that teams are reminded of user dissatisfaction at the right moment and provides support agents with the necessary context to take timely action.
