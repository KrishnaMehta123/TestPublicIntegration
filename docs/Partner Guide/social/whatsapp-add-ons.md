# Overview

CleverTap's WhatsApp add-ons provide businesses with a powerful set of tools to include WhatsApp in their marketing communication strategy. Customers can easily [create WhatsApp campaigns](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/create-message-whatsapp) and journeys and analyze their performance in one place by enabling Whatsapp add-ons for their accounts. 

CleverTap offers two add-ons for WhatsApp integration:

- [WhatsApp Connect](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/whatsapp-add-ons#whatsapp-connect)
- [WhatsApp Direct](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/whatsapp-add-ons#whatsapp-direct)

Using these add-ons, CleverTap customers can now access the following features:

## Targeting Users

With CleverTap's WhatsApp add-ons, customers can easily target users at the right time with highly-personalized messaging using rich media interactive templates. These [WhatsApp campaigns](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/whatsapp) can be created and scheduled for optimal engagement.

## Analyzing Campaign Performance

## Monitoring User Behavior

Customers can monitor the impact of WhatsApp notifications on overall user behavior using CleverTap's advanced analytics feature. This data can provide insights into how users engage with WhatsApp notifications and how they impact overall user behavior.

In addition to messaging and campaign tools, CleverTap's WhatsApp add-ons allow customers to build relationships with their end users. The Agent-chat feature allows for real-time user interactions, while the [auto-responder](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/conversations#auto-responders) feature allows businesses to quickly and efficiently respond to customer inquiries.

> 🚧 Note
> 
> - CleverTap allows you to set up and test WhatsApp configuration with both external WhatsApp providers and CleverTap BSP without purchasing any add-ons. However, you cannot create and publish WhatsApp campaigns or journeys.
> - WhatsApp conversations such as FAQ, auto-reply, and agent chat also require an add-on purchase.

# WhatsApp Connect

WhatsApp Connect is an add-on for customers using external WhatsApp providers with CleverTap. Using WhatsApp Connect, you cannot create or publish campaigns and journeys using the CleverTap BSP WhatsApp configuration. 

> 🚧 Note
> 
> - WhatsApp notifications are not delivered if the WhatsApp add-on is disabled on your account.
> - CleverTap currently supports only a limited number of external WhatsApp providers. We recommend you check the [list of supported partners](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generic-whatsapp#supported-business-service-providers) to ensure your partner is supported before purchasing WhatsApp Connect.

## Billing Calculation

Customers using the WhatsApp Connect add-on are charged for notifications sent through external providers via campaigns, journey, agent-chat, and autoresponders from the CleverTap dashboard. 

CleverTap offers multiple notification tiers with a base fee and overage rates for the WhatsApp Connect add-on. You must estimate your monthly WhatsApp notifications to choose a relevant notification tier for your business. It is important to choose the appropriate notification tier to avoid any unexpected overage charges. 

Contact your sales or account manager for more information on choosing the right notification tier for your business.

## Overage Calculation

As explained earlier, CleverTap offers multiple notification tiers along with a base fee and overage rates for the WhatsApp Connect add-on. It is important to choose the appropriate notification tier to avoid any unexpected overage charges. 

If you exceed your monthly quota of notifications for any given month, you are charged overage fees for additional notifications at agreed overage rates as per your contract.

This helps ensures that businesses can budget accurately for their WhatsApp notification needs and only pay for what they use. If you have any questions or need more information about CleverTap's notification tiers, contact your sales or account manager.

Consider the following example to understand the overage calculation better:

- A business pays $30 for a monthly plan that includes 10,000 notifications. The overage is $0.0070 per notification.  
  The business sends 15,000 notifications that month. They pay an overage cost of $35 for the extra 5,000 notifications. 

The overage is calculated as:

- Overage = Number of additional notifications used \* Overage cost per notification
- That is, 5000 \* 0.0070 = $35  
  Therefore, the total cost for the month is $65 ($30 base plan fee + $35 overage cost).

# WhatsApp Direct

WhatsApp Direct add-on is applicable to customers who prefer to use CleverTap BSP (CleverTap's WhatsApp solution) as their WhatsApp provider. This add-on enables customers to access the WhatsApp Business API directly through CleverTap, eliminating the need for external providers.

CleverTap offers multiple conversation tiers, which include a base fee, consumption overage rates, and fair usage overage rates for the WhatsApp Direct add-on.

It is essential to estimate the number of monthly WhatsApp conversations accurately to choose the appropriate notification tier for your business. Contact your sales/account manager for further details.

## Billing Calculation

The billing for WhatsApp Direct add-on is based on two components:

- WhatsApp Charges - The WhatsApp conversation is [billed by Meta ](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/) on a pay-as-you-go basis. You can verify your WhatsApp conversation charges from your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA).CleverTap will apply a service markup over the Meta charges.
  - To check your WhatsApp billing amount from WABA:
    1. Go to Account Tools, Insights > WhatsApp Manager
    2. Select your WhatsApp Account
    3. Select the required conversation and date range. 
- CleverTap Platform fee - CleverTap offers multiple conversation tiers, which include a base fee and consumption overage rates. Choosing the appropriate notification tier is important to avoid any unexpected overage charges.

Contact your sales or account manager for more information on choosing the right notification tier for your business. 

## Overage Calculation

The billing for conversations is handled directly by WhatsApp. As explained earlier, CleverTap offers a platform fee based on multiple notification tiers. Customers are charged a flat overage rate if their monthly consumption of conversation exceeds their chosen notification tier.
