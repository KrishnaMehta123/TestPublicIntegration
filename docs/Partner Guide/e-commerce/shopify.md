## Import Existing Shopify Data into CleverTap

CleverTap's Historical Data Import feature helps synchronize existing Shopify user and transaction data by allowing you to upload all your historical data directly to CleverTap.

    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/168b91fb5bc61e6b3694c0576351543a680b886f74698f3fa7735c18c968826a-historical_.png",
        "",
        "Historical Data Import"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Historical Data Import"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can upload the following types of data:

- **Profile Data**: Includes user information such as name, email, phone number, and so on. This is mapped as Profile Properties on the CleverTap dashboard. Refer to the [sample profile data file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11e16DkoSHT_zeYgaa2E_hJjHVO9U4VSzoR4nXb_xXAY/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Purchase Data**: Includes transaction data such as order data. This is mapped as Charged Event on the CleverTap dashboard. Refer to the [sample purchase data file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gyycrJlx6NgaftxJMJpKXig3mI8fYSTFz9Honp9Ltzs/edit?usp=sharing).

To upload your Shopify website data on CleverTap, follow the steps below:

1. Download a CSV file from your Shopify dashboard. This file can either be a **Profile CSV** with user data or a **Charged Event CSV**  with transaction data.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/f64dcd8c88237e5388b979d14e2d5cb8bb93985d7261e40d43661766b6c9539b-Shopify_Admin_Panel.png",

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Shopify Dashboard"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. To upload the CSV file to CleverTap, go to _Settings_ > _Project_ and click **Shopify**.  
3. Select the upload option: **Profiles** or **Charged Events**. The system starts processing the uploaded file immediately.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [

      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9601297b3d90c605de105f3841df3c2bf91147152d447faacb905c89e6cb0e63-Historical_data_import.png",
        "",
        "Historical Data Import"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Historical Data Import"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Track the status of your upload at any time. Statuses include:

- **Pending**: The file has been received and is waiting to be processed.
- **Processing**: The system is validating and ingesting the data.
- **Importing**: The data is actively being ingested and merged into your CleverTap project.
- **Merged**: All rows are processed and added to your CleverTap project.
- **Merged with Errors**: The file is processed and merged, but some rows contain issues. You can check the error details, fix the data, and re-upload the CSV.
- **Failed**: The upload has failed due to formatting or validation issues. 
- **Paused**: Processing has been paused manually, or there may be a system interruption.

5. After processing, you will receive an email with a CSV file attached only for rows that encountered errors. This file includes an additional column indicating the reason for failure. In case of errors, fix the failed rows and re-upload only the affected rows. Multiple uploads are supported if required.

Once your data is merged, you can create campaigns, run analytics, and fully utilize the CleverTap platform. Profiles and events can be found in your CleverTap dashboard for further engagement. 

> 📘 Note
> 
> - Events containing any error columns will be silently ignored and dropped.
> - Ensure every user record has at least one valid identity field. The value must be under **1024 characters**. If this condition is not met, the following error will occur: `Identity value cannot be null or set at least one of identity / fbId / gpId / objectId under 1024 chars to identify the user`. 
> - The maximum file size for historical backfill uploads is 5 GB.
> - The following four columns are mandatory for a Charged file upload:
>   - Name
>   - Email
>   - Id
>   - Phone
> - Profile and Purchase data must be uploaded as two separate files.
> - If your mobile number is used as an identity, always search it in the CSV using the full international format. For example: `+91XXXXXXXXXX`.

## Advanced Customization

After your store is connected and installed, you can start customizing it per your requirements. You can configure the web push for your store and also customize the event data received from your Shopify store. 

### Configure Web Push

You can send personalized communication to your users through Web Push notifications. However, you must enable them first from the CleverTap dashboard.

Check that Web Push is configured for your store. If not configured, you must  [configure the Web Push](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/setup-web-push)  from the CleverTap dashboard.

After the Web Push is configured, enable the notification prompts. Click _Web Push configuration_  and toggle ON  _ Send notification permission prompt_  to enable CleverTap Web Push notifications.

The _App Embed_ status displays as _Enabled_ if enabled already. 

The _App Embed_ status informs you if it is active. By default, app embed blocks are deactivated after an app is installed. However, if the _App Embed_ status is _Disabled_ , merchants must activate app embed blocks in the theme editor, from their Shopify theme settings. Refer to this detailed document on [App embeds](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions/extensions-framework#app-embed-blocks) to learn more.

To enable _CleverTap-Shopify App Embed_ on your Shopify store:

# Cart Abandonment Use Case

Cart personalization allows businesses to send dynamic cart abandonment emails displaying all the products users have left in their cart without making a purchase. Events such as _Add to Cart_ store the most recent product added to the cart. This limitation prevents a real-time view of all the products in the cart, making it difficult to run campaigns that fully reflect the user’s cart activity.

CleverTap uses a combination of User Properties and Catalog Personalization to achieve the card abandonment use case:

- User Properties: Stores variant IDs in an array format when users add items to their cart. These properties update dynamically when items are added or removed during checkout.
- Catalogs: These contain additional product details, such as product name, image URL, and price, and are synced in the CleverTap dashboard using the Shopify Catalog Sync feature. 

This approach enables businesses to create dynamic campaigns that accurately reflect the state of the user’s cart. By combining user properties with catalogs and advanced personalization techniques like liquid tags, CleverTap enhances the effectiveness of cart abandonment campaigns, delivering an effortless shopping experience.

> 📘 Note
> 
> Cart Personalization works only if the _Added to Cart, Charged_, and _Removed from Cart_ events are sourced through the CleverTap Shopify plugin. Custom implementations of these events are not supported.

## Live Action Email Campaign

Learn how to create personalized cart abandonment emails using CleverTap's Live Action Email campaigns. 

### Scenario

A user visits an e-commerce store and adds multiple items to their shopping cart. However, the user leaves the website without making a purchase.

### Objective

Using Cart Personalization, you can:

- Encourage users to complete their purchases by sending tailored, timely reminders via Email.
- Recover potential lost revenue.
- Provide a personalized and seamless shopping experience for the users.

### Steps to Implement Cart Abandonment Campaigns

To set up an Email campaign, follow these steps on the CleverTap Dashboard:

1. **Toggle the _Catalog Sync_ feature:**

Toggle the _ [Catalog Sync](doc:shopify#catalog-sync)_ feature to automatically sync product data between customers' Shopify and CleverTap accounts. 

2. **Toggle the _Cart Tracking_ feature:**  
   This feature ensures that the variant IDs from the users' cart are stored in their CleverTap profile. For example, when a user adds a product to their cart, the variant ID will be saved as a user property in an array format in the user's profile, under the _shopify_cart_ids_. Similarly, when a user removes a product from the cart, the variant ID will be removed automatically. To enable Cart Tracking in your dashboard:
   1. Go to the Shopify Integration page within CleverTap.
   2. Click the **Advanced Customization** section.
   3. Toggle on the _Cart Tracking_ feature.

      "border": true,
      "caption": "Cart Sync Toggle"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. **Create the Campaign:**

Define the campaign as an inaction campaign targeting users who added products to the cart but did not complete a checkout action within 15 minutes.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/adf624ca6ddb47cb4b9e46c437ecfff5dafd548a710f3c2aa9bb60e51ac05c08-Screenshot_2024-12-05_at_11.27.46_AM.png",
        null,
        "Inaction Campaign"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "60% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Inaction Campaign"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


For more information, refer to [Create an Email Campaign](doc:create-message-email).

4. **Mapping the campaign with Catalog:**
   1. Go to _What_ section of the campaign editor and click on _Personalization_. 
   2. From the _Catalog_ tab, select _shopify-catalog_.
   3. Select the _shopify_cart_ids_ user property and map it to the _Identity_ column in the catalog.

        "https://files.readme.io/ec0aefb4bb66864d8dbcdc65e7631e30176716400cb2ba588cbdcba56a8f8b8d-2025-02-17_19-02-10.png",

        "Mapping the Catalog"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Mapping the Catalog"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


5. **Set Up _Personalization_ with Liquid Tags:**
   1. In the _What_ section of the email body editor, drag a _Text_ field into the email body.
   2. Click on **More** and select the _Customize with Liquid tags_ option. 
   3. Use Liquid Tags to dynamically fetch the  product details (name, image, price, etc.) from the catalog's CSV file.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/17734120560e5e20a2df3dfd1126e1d61124115cdf586a37fd88937874a783a0-Image_4.jpeg",
        null,
        "Liquid Tags"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Liquid Tags"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


For example, you can use HTML tags to create a table and `For loop` in Liquid tags to traverse the Catalog. The `For loop` will run until it covers all the Variant IDs in the Profile property.

```text
<inline-editor>
  {% for item in Catalog.Samplecatalog1 %}
  <table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse'>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="{{ item.ImageURL | default: 'No Image' }}" width="100" height="100">
      </td>
      <td width="100" height="100">
        {{ item.Identity }}
      </td>
      <td width="100" height="100">
        {{ item.Name }}
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  {% endfor %}
</inline-editor>
```

> ℹ️ Key Considerations
> 
> If a user empties the cart without performing the Charged event, the `For loop` in the liquid tags will not run. Consequently, the Email will be delivered without product data, as the user remains eligible for the campaign despite having no variant IDs. Therefore, ensure that the email templates are designed to handle scenarios where the product table does not render, maintaining a professional appearance.

6. **Apply Frequency Caps:**

To prevent multiple emails on every _Add to Cart_ event trigger for a single user, apply a frequency cap within the campaign to send only one email per cart addition.

7. **Test the Email to ensure correctness:**

You can test the campaign to ensure personalized rendering of product details from the products left in your cart.
