CleverTap partners with leading RCS service providers such as [Infobip](doc:rcs-infobip) to help you deliver rich, interactive messaging experiences to your users. Through this integration, you can configure Infobip as your RCS provider within CleverTap, send messages directly via Infobip’s infrastructure, and track delivery, read receipts, and user interactions in real time. This setup allows you to manage and optimize your RCS campaigns end-to-end—from targeting to performance analysis—right from the CleverTap dashboard.

> 📘 Note:
>
> If your RCS provider is not listed, configure RCS delivery using the Generic SMS (HTTP) route. Go to *Settings > Channels > SMS > SMS Connect* to add your provider’s RCS API and callbacks. After configuration, create your campaign using the RCS Message Editor. Refer to [Generic SMS ](doc:generic-sms)for configuration instructions.
