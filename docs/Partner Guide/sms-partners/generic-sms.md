# Overview

CleverTap supports any SMS provider via an HTTP integration, provided they support receiving messages via the HTTP protocol. In addition to this, CleverTap Generic SMS integration also supports [setting up callbacks](doc:generic-sms#configure-sms-callback) that help track detailed reports of every SMS being sent from the CleverTap dashboard like Clicked, Delivered, Replied, and Delivery-related errors.

# Integrate an SMS Provider

To integrate an SMS provider, perform the following steps:

1. In the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Engage* > *Channels* > *SMS*.
2. Click **+ Add Provider**.

# Set Up Your Message Payload

To determine the parameters your SMS provider supports, you can ask for a curl request from your SMS service provider or check the payload structure defined in the provider documentation. 

To set up your message payload, perform the following steps:

1. In the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Engage* > *Channels* > *SMS*.
2. Click on the **+ Add Provider** button.
3. Under *Provider*, select *Other (Generic)*.
4. If the provider specifies all information, such as a phone number, a message body, or a template, should be passed under *Headers*, then under *Headers*, enter key and value pairs.

<Image title="Screen Shot 2018-08-30 at 4.14.49 PM.png" align="center" className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/67d5387-Screen_Shot_2018-08-30_at_4.14.49_PM.png" />

4. If the provider specifies all information, such as a phone number, a message body, or a template, should be passed under *Body*, then under *Parameters*, select the supported encoding:
   * x-www-form-urlencoded: Within this format, all values are passed as key-value pairs, which are used when creating campaigns.

<Image title="Screenshot 2021-05-12 at 4.26.41 PM.png" align="center" className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/bd4a734-Screenshot_2021-05-12_at_4.26.41_PM.png" />

* JSON: Within this format, the exact payload is defined in a JSON structure. This is used to define the payload structure for all outgoing requests of this particular provider.

<Image alt="JSON Payload Structure for Outgoing Requests" align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/4039cdc-JSON_Payload_Structure_for_Outgoing_Requests.png" /> JSON Payload Structure for Outgoing Requests

## System Dynamic Replacements

You can use the following five dynamic replacements within the key-value pairs in the headers or parameters tabs:
* $$To: A mandatory replacement value used to signify the key where the phone number is added to the payload.
* $$Body: An optional replacement value used to signify the key where the body of the message is added to the payload. Every configuration needs to have $$Body or $$TemplateID key as a mandatory replacement.
* $$TemplateID: An optional replacement value used to signify the key where the TemplateID of the message is added to the payload. Every configuration needs to have $$TemplateID or $$Body key as a mandatory replacement. This variable is optional and only applicable for campaigns targeted to **Indian mobile numbers**. Refer to the [Regulation Impact](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/regulation-impact#section-future-campaigns) guide to learn more.
* $$TemplateVariables: An optional replacement value used to signify the key where the template variables of the message are added to the payload. 
* $$CampaignID: An optional replacement value used to signify the key where the CleverTap campaign ID is added to the payload.
* $$MessageID: A dynamic replacement parameter replaced by CleverTap with a specific value in the outgoing SMS payload to the provider's endpoint. The provider must send the same value in the [callback](doc:generic-sms#configure-sms-callback) request to CleverTap's callback URL in the meta key. This is mandatory in case of DLR (clicks, delivered, replied, and delivery-related errors) tracking.

## Custom Dynamic Replacements

In addition to system dynamic replacements, any configuration can have a custom dynamic replacement which is available on the campaign creation flow as a mandatory input. 

The following is an example of a configuration to better understand the setup:

```json
{
  "hid": "$$hid", //Global Key-Value pair
  "tid": "$$TemplateID",
  "cid": "$$CampaignID",
  "type": "template",
  "msgs": [
    {
      "seq": 1,
      "to": "$$To",
      "mid": "$$MessageID", //to be added for configuring callbacks
      "uid": "$$uid", //Message Body Key-Value pair
      "variables": "$$TemplateVariables",
      "enc": "utf8"
    }
  ]
}
```

The entire payload has two parts:

1. Message Body Key-Value Pairs: The keys are `seq`, `to`, `uid`, `variables`, and `enc`.
2. Global Key-Value Pairs: The keys are `hid`, `tid`, `cid`, and `type`.

In this configuration, a single msg record will be set up in the key `msgs` and all the message body key-value pairs are used with a user-level personalization. On the other hand, $$hid is a custom dynamic replacement that cannot be personalized on a user level, but the value can be set for each campaign.

Here is another example without batching:

```json
{
  "hid": "$$hid",//Message Body Key-Value pair
  "tid": "$$TemplateID",
  "cid": "$$CampaignID",
  "type": "template",
  "seq": 1,
  "to": "$$To",
  "mid": "$$MessageID", //to be added for configuring callbacks
  "uid": "$$uid",//Message Body Key-Value pair
  "variables": "$$TemplateVariables",
  "enc": "utf8"
}
```

In the example above, there is no bifurcation of the payload. Global and message key-value pairs are on the same level, and therefore, no batching is possible as each record will ping the provider individually. All dynamic replacements would be available for user-level personalization.

> 📘 Encoding
>
> The messages sent out from CleverTap are encoded in the UTF-8 charset.

# SMS Callbacks

SMS callbacks help you track detailed reports of every SMS being sent from the CleverTap dashboard. All this information is received on the Callback URL present under the Provider *Setup* tab on the CleverTap dashboard. For now, this feature is available only for Generic SMS Integration. If you already have a provider saved, you must set up a new one with the same configuration details along with additional information for SMS callbacks explained in the [Configure SMS Callback](doc:generic-sms#configure-sms-callback) section.

<Image title="Callback URL.png" alt={676} align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/64207ba-Callback_URL.png" />  Callback URL on CleverTap Dashboard

## Configure SMS Callback

During the SMS provider setup process, you must specify the *mid* key (you can have a custom name for this key) with  *$$MessageID* as the value. *$$MessageID* is the dynamic replacement parameter, replaced by CleverTap with the specific value in the outgoing SMS payload to the provider's endpoint. The provider must send the same value in the callback request to CleverTap's callback URL in the meta key mentioned under Send Callback Events section.

## Sample Request
This section provides information about the sample request payload sent to SMS providers. 

### Sample Request with Batching

The following is a sample request payload structure with batching:

```json
{
	"tid": "$$TemplateID",
	"msgs": [{
		"seq": 1,
		"to": "$$To",
    "mid": "$$MessageID",
		"uid": "$$uid",
		"body": "$$Body",
		"enc": "utf8"
	}]
```

> 📘 Batch Size Limit
>
> CleverTap supports a maximum batch size of 100 records.

### Sample Request without Batching

The following is a sample request payload structure without batching:

```json
{

	"tid": "$$TemplateID",
	"to": "$$To",
	"uid": "$$uid",
  "mid": "$$MessageID",
	"body": "$$Body",
	"enc": "utf8"

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Send Callback Events

To send callback events to CleverTap, customers must send a POST request to CleverTap's callback URL. The following is the acceptable callback payload structure:

```json
[
  {
    "event": "delivered",
    "data": [
      {
        "ts": 1435322805,
        "meta": "9999999999.1200000000.165263328.20220606.0.wzrk_default.1.",
        "description": "Delivered to handset"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The following table provides a brief description of the keys present in the callback payload:

| Key Name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     | Sample Values                                               |

\*The asterisk mark against the key name indicates that keys are mandatory in the callback payload. 

> 📘 Note
>
> If the payload includes additional key-value pairs apart from the ones that are defined in the acceptable sample payload for each event, CleverTap does not throw any errors, but simply disregards those.

## Error Codes

If there is an error in the SMS delivery, these error codes indicate the nature of an error encountered.  Each error code corresponds to a specific error description. The error descriptions are displayed within the Errors tab within the campaign stats section in case of any delivery-related failures. The following table provides information about the acceptable error codes:

      </td>

      <td>
        DND Failure refers to a scenario where a text message was not delivered to a recipient due to their phone number being registered on the national Do Not Disturb (DND) registry, which contains a list of phone numbers that have opted out of receiving promotional or marketing messages.

      <td>
        One of the most common reasons for SMS delivery failure is carrier-level spam filters. Carriers have added systems and algorithms that detect spam content and then block these messages. Unfortunately, these filters are hidden, subject to carrier preferences, vary from carrier to carrier, and can be changed without notice.
