# SMTP Callbacks

SMTP Callbacks provide insights into delivery success, failures, unsubscribes, and spam reports of your SMTP email provider. These insights help optimize strategies and improve email campaign performance through the following:

* *Notification Delivered Event*: The Notification Delivered event is raised when the campaign is delivered to the intended user. 
* *Notification Failed Event*: The *Notification Failed* event is raised to track delivery issues such as hard and soft bounces. The `error` parameter in this event specifies the reason for the failure, such as hard bounce, soft bounce, spam, or unsubscribed.
* *Profile Unsubscribes*: When users unsubscribe, mark emails as spam, or experience a hard bounce (excluding soft bounces), their profiles are automatically unsubscribed from future communications, triggering the Channel Unsubscribed event.

Callback requests must be made to CleverTap's *Callback URL*. The ESP must add this URL to their Email Provider Settings to pass these callback events to CleverTap. You can find the CleverTap *Callback URL* under the Provider *Setup* tab on the CleverTap dashboard.

<Image alt="Callback URL for Provider Setup" align="center" width="65%" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/9fe779db4301b182af414e4d5208ea8d21a6b6659f3ad3b56f306da50a5bedd3-Callback_URL_on_CleverTap_dashboard.png" />

## Configure SMTP Callback

In the outgoing email SMTP payload, CleverTap sends the `X-CleverTap_META` key with a specific value. The provider must send the same value in the callback payload to CleverTap's callback URL within the `meta` key. When received along with the incoming callback payload, this helps attribute a callback to the correct profile and campaign.

## Send Callback Events

To send callback events to CleverTap, customers must send a POST request to CleverTap's *Callback URL*. The following is a sample callback payload:
The following table provides a brief description of the keys present in the callback payload:

<Table align={["left","left","left","left"]}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required/Optional</th>
      <th>Values / Examples</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>version</td>
      <td>Denotes the payload version. This must be set to `v2` to track the delivery-related information such as success, failures, unsubscribes, and spam reports.</td>
      <td>Required</td>
      <td>`v2`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>event</td>
      <td>Denotes the event name.</td>
      <td>Required</td>
      <td>`failed`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>type</td>
      <td>Indicates the delivery status of the message. Possible values: `delivered` (denotes that the campaigns was delivered to the intended user), `hard_bounce` (denotes that an email delivery failed due to a permanent delivery issue, for example, an invalid email address), `soft_bounce` (denotes that an email delivery failed for temporary issues, for example, recipient inbox full, server errors, and so on), `spam` (denotes that the recipient marked the email as spam), `unsubscribed` (denotes that the recipient unsubscribed from emails).</td>
      <td>Required</td>
      <td>`hard_bounce`, `soft_bounce`, `spam`, `unsubscribed`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>email</td>
      <td>Denotes the email address of the recipient.</td>
      <td>Required</td>
      <td>`user1@example.com`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>meta</td>
      <td>CleverTap sends the key `X-CleverTap_META` in the SMTP payload with a specific value. The provider must return this value as is, in the callback payload under the `meta` key to properly attribute the callback to the correct profile and campaign.</td>
      <td>Required</td>
      <td>Replacement - `X-CleverTap_META`. For example, `user1@example.com\|1568798080\|1730714617\|20241104\|0\|wzrk_default\|-17005904\|`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>description</td>
      <td>An optional field to add more descriptive information regarding the callback event for analysis (for example, `User unsubscribed from campaign`). This is reflected in the `reason` event property of the *Channel Unsubscribed* event, offering additional details for error analysis.</td>
      <td>Optional</td>
      <td>`Soft bounce detected` - Denotes that the email to the intended user resulted in a soft bounce.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

> 📘 Note
>
> If the payload includes additional key-value pairs apart from the ones that are defined in the acceptable sample payload for each event, CleverTap does not throw any errors, but simply disregards those.

## Incoming Payload Mapping to System Events

CleverTap maps the following incoming payloads with their respective system events:

* *Notification Delivered*: This event is raised when the message is delivered to the intended user. The event property *Provider* specifies the email provider used to send the campaign, for example, `Generic email` indicates that the campaign was sent using a generic email provider configuration.

<Image alt="Payload Mapping for Notification Delivered Event" align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/880f068ac1c7354fbac73283f8dc5236108e6bd989f4111d234876bcaee028fd-Payload_Mapping_for_Notfication_Delivered.png" />

* *Notification Failed*: This event is raised if the callback event field`type` has values such as `hard_bounce` or `soft_bounce`. The event property `Error` of the *Notification Failed* event specifies the type of failure, that is, hard bounce or soft bounce.

<Image alt="Payload Mapping for Notification Failed Event " align="center" width="75% " border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/da2171626588fcede1fcc150339bcb29a6eaac74f52729a10d1e993fcb9d8464-Notification_Failed_Mapping_.png" />

* *Channel Unsubscribed*: This event is raised if the callback event field `type` has values such as `unsubscribed`, `spam`, or `hard_bounce`. The event property *Type* of the *Channel Unsubscribed* event specifies the reason for profile unsubscription.

## Response Codes

CleverTap sends the following status codes and descriptions as a response to the ESP upon receiving callbacks:

| Status Code | Description                        | Explanation                                                                                               |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | -                                  | Success                                                                                                   |
| 400         | Mandatory parameter missing        | This occurs when any mandatory keys are missing from the payload or when the payload format is incorrect. |
|             | More than allowed events were sent | This occurs if more than 1000 events are sent in a single API call.                                       |
|             | invalid payload                    | This occurs when the payload is not as per defined payload structure.                                     |
| 500         | Server error                       | CleverTap internal server error. Contact CleverTap support if the issue persists.                         |

### Sample Response

The following is the sample response sent by CleverTap to the provider upon processing the callback payload successfully:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Callback processed successfully"
}
```

The following is the sample response sent by CleverTap to the providers upon partial processing of callback events:

```json
{
  "status": "partial_success",
  "processed": 850,
  "failed": 150,
  "errors": [
    {
      "event_index": 5,
      "error": "Invalid email format"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following is the sample error response:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Mandatory parameter missing: meta",
  "error_code": 400
}
```

# Troubleshooting

* As you are using your SMTP gateway, some email providers, such as Gmail and Yahoo, might not deliver the email to your inbox.
* Check if you have set up DKIM and SPF correctly.
* Check if Spamhaus has blacklisted your IP/domain.
