Before you can start using Inbox previews, you must enable them.\
In the dashboard.\
Navigate to *Settings> Channels > Email*.\
Click the **Previews** tab.

The Setup previews page lists previews for the available email inboxes. For example, a mobile device that runs Gmail on Android 8 or a computer that runs Apple Mail 10 on an OSX 10.10 Operating system.

> You must specify the accounts that must have email previews and spam reports before signing up. Email previews are available only if you have opted for the email add-on from CleverTap.\
> This feature is not available for trial accounts.

# Enable or Disable Previews
