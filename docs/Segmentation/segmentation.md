# Overview

A segment in CleverTap is a group of users with the same characteristics, such as actions performed, actions not performed, or user profile properties based on the defined criteria. For example, a segment can be users who launched the app for the first time in the past 30 days. A more complex segment could be users who live in New York, were acquired via a Facebook campaign in April, transacted three or more times in May and June, and have not transacted in the past two weeks.

From the _Segments_ page, you can create segments, perform different operations on the segments, and view segment trends over time to understand how a segment behaves in response to your marketing initiatives. The entire CleverTap dashboard can be filtered by any segment you create, including any of our analytics features.
