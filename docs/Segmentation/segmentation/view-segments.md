# Overview

You can view the details of a segment to understand more about the underlying query. These details help you understand the following:

* Segment triggers and rules based on behavior and interests
* Frequency of users qualifying in a segment
* Reachability of qualified users with different engagement channels
* Qualified user profiles

# View Segment Details

You can view Past Behavior and Live Segment details from the dashboard. To view segment details:

1. Navigate to *Segments* > *Segments*.
2. Search for the segment you are looking for, then click on it.

On clicking, it displays the following details:

* **Segment Trend**: Displays the number of users who qualified for the segment going forward, starting from the first full day after the segment creation.

* **Insights**

Displays the number of users reachable via different messaging channels and sample user profiles who qualify for the segment.

You can now view Segment Insights in two modes:

* **Estimate (Default):** Shows approximate statistics for the segment to enable faster loading and quicker reachability insights.
* **Exact:** Displays precise data for the segment after complete processing, providing the most accurate user counts across all channels.

You can use Estimate to quickly preview reachability and switch to Exact when you need accurate data before taking action.

> 📘 Mismatch in Segment Size and Number of Users Exported to CSV File
>
> The number of users displayed under the *Segment size and reachability* section may vary from the number of users exported to the CSV file. This variation is due to the inclusion of blacklisted users under the *Segment size and reachability* section.

* **Segment trend**: If the users have increased or decreased over time. 
* **Campaigns and journeys**: The number of campaigns and Journeys currently using the custom list segment. 
* **Segment size and reachability**: The total number of users in the segment and their reachability across various engagement channels.
