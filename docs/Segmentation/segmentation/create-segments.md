# Overview

Creating segments in CleverTap empowers you to target and engage specific groups of users precisely based on various criteria. This flexibility enables you to design segments based on past behavior and live user interaction with the app. The steps to create Segments vary based on the type of segment you want to create.

# Create Past Behavior Segments

Consider the example of creating an action-based segment where users qualify if they purchased a particular product at least once in the past 30 days.

To create the above example segment, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to _Segments_ > _Segments_ from the dashboard.
2. Click **+Segment**.
3. Select the _Past Behavior_ segment type.
4. Click **Add a rule group to start building your query**.
5. Select the _Event (Did)_ rule from the _User Behavior_ option.
6. Select the _Charged_ event where the count is one and then click **Refresh Data**.

        "",
        "Create Past Behavior Segment"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Create Past Behavior Segment"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The qualified segment of users for the defined rule is calculated.

        "https://files.readme.io/a842acb-Reachability_Stats.png",
        null,
        "View Reachability of Qualified Users"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "View Reachability of Qualified Users"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


7. Click **Save Segment**.
8. Enter the _Segment name_ and click **Save**.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/1379c79-Save_Past_Behavior_Segment.gif",
        "",
        "Save Segment"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Save Segment"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Your new segment, _ Charged Users _, can now be seen in the main section on the _Segments_ page.

To know more about creating more complex rules, refer to the [Segmentation Rules](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/segmentation-rules).

# Create Live User Segments

Consider the example of creating an _Inaction in Time Frame_ segment for which users will qualify in real-time as soon as they add a product to the cart but do not purchase it within 10 minutes.

> 📘 Golden Window for Mobile Transactions
> 
> The golden window within which most users transact on our iOS and Android app platforms is within 10 minutes.

To create the above example segment, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to _Segments_ > _Segments_ from the dashboard.
2. Click **+ Segment**.
3. Select the _Live - Inaction in Time Frame_ segment type.
4. Select the _Added to Cart_ event and set the _DOES NOT DO Charged within_ as **10** _minutes_.
5. You may select the _Filter on past behavior and common properties_ checkbox to apply filters to past actions, inactions, or common user property filters.
6. Click **Save segment**.
7. Enter the _Segment name_ and click **Save**.

        "https://files.readme.io/5e2370b-Create_Live_User_Segment.gif",
        "",
        "Create Live - Inaction in Time Frame Segment"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Create Live - Inaction in Time Frame Segment"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Your new segment, _Added to cart but no charge within 10 minutes_, can now be seen in the main section on the _Segments_ page.

## Create Live Segments with Multiple Triggers

The Multi-Triggers feature lets you segment users based on one or more events. Consider an example of _Live - User Actions_ segments where users qualify as soon as they perform any of the following events:

- App Launched
- UTM Visited
- Notification Clicked

To create a live user segment with multiple triggers:

1. Navigate to _Segments_ > _Segments_ from the dashboard.
2. Click **+ Segment** and select the _Live - User Actions_ segment type.
3. Click **Add Event** and select the events from the list. In this example, select the _App Launched_, _UTM Visited_, and _Notification Clicked_ events.
4. Click **Save segment**.
5. Enter the _Segment name_ and click **Save**.

        "Multi-Triggers in Segments"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Create Live Segments with Multiple Triggers"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> 📘 Note
> 
> - You can add a maximum of 10 events for multi-trigger.
> - Multi-Triggers are exclusive to the _Live - User Actions_ segment.

# Create Custom - List Based Segments

You can create a custom list segment by uploading user lists via the dashboard or API. 

> 📘 File Size
> 
> You can upload a maximum file size of 50 MB from the dashboard. The maximum file size allowed from an API upload is 5GB.

## File Format

Only CSV file format is supported for upload. Also, the list of users for your segment must follow a specific format. You can upload the profiles with identity type as _CleverTap ID_ (g) or _GUID_ and _identity_ (i). 

The format of the CSV file is as follows:

| Type | Identity                                        |
| :--- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| g    | a1e2723cba7c4518bea8ef95b036ac83                |
| i    | [user@clevertap.com](mailto:user@clevertap.com) |

The Type and Identity columns are mandatory for successfully uploading a custom list segment in the above format.  

The **Type** field specifies the type of identity used for each segment user. This can be either `g` for CleverTap ID or GUID for a third-party identifier, and `i` for identity.

The **Identity** field contains the sample value of the identifier for each user, which can be a string or a number, depending on the identifier type. For example, if using the `i` type, the identity field might contain email addresses, phone numbers, or your custom identifier for each user.

> 🚧 User Profiles
> 
> A Custom - List Based segment can only contain user profiles that are on the CleverTap dashboard. It does not create any new profiles or update the attributes for the existing user profiles.

## Create from Dashboard

1. Navigate to _Segments_ > _Segments_. 
2. Click **+ Segment**. 
3. Click **Custom - List Based**.
