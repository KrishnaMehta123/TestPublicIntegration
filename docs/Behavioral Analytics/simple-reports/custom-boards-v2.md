# Overview

The _Custom Boards_ is a feature in CleverTap that allows you to create and customize your board. CleverTap provides a set of default boards, such as the [Today View](doc:today-view), [Mobile App View](doc:mobile-app-view), [Uninstalls View](doc:uninstalls-view), [Revenue View ](doc:revenue-view), [NPS view](doc:nps-board), which you can use to analyze user activity in your application.

Each custom board you create is composed of Tiles, which are widgets you can pin to the board to track the metrics of your interest. You can pin Tiles and track the metrics using one of the following features: [Funnels](doc:funnels) and [Trends](doc:trends).

> 📘 Private Beta
>
> Currently, this feature is a Private Beta Release. If you want access to this feature, contact your Customer Success Manager.

For example, if you want to track the following metrics for the last 30 days:

* Weekly comparison of Unique users who purchased
* Total purchases by brand

As shown in the following image, you can create a custom board and add Tiles to track the above metrics. You can also pin those Tiles to the board.

After you build your custom board, you can also share the board with others in your organization.

Custom boards can have the following features:

* [Boards](doc:custom-dashboards#boards)
* [Tiles](doc:custom-dashboards#cards)

# Boards

The board's section provides information about different boards created for the project and the operations that can be performed on these boards. On this page, users can view a list of all boards:

* Created by them,
* Shared with them, and
* Public boards that are available for users in their organization.

To access boards on the CleveTap dashboard, go to _Analytics_ > _Boards BETA. The_All boards_ page opens.

<Image align="center" alt="List of Boards" border={true} caption="List of Boards" src="https://files.readme.io/c736a32d0cae70aa89558c968d1744d0c783b08f34e27acf0970f70c31fd1c9f-image.png" />

## Create a Custom Board

This section covers how to create a custom board. To create a board:

1. Go to _Analytics_ > _Boards BETA_ from the left navigation menu.
2. Click **Create Board**.
3. Enter your board name and click **Create**.

## Operations

You can perform the following actions on a particular board:

### Share

CleverTap provides restricted board access so that the board owner can control the members who can view and contribute to the insights captured on the board. The board owner can add or remove members from the access list and can control access levels.

To share a board, perform the following steps:

1. Create your custom board.
2. Click the **Share** ![](https://files.readme.io/0710b8affc42e1398a0baf1d52f4a6c0eab19a0c4ed1ae6749f34d04e93fe6f9-Share_Me.png) icon. The _Share Board_ popup displays with restricted permissions by default. Use the search box to view and add users to this board.

<Image align="center" alt="Share the board" border={true} caption="Share the board" src="https://files.readme.io/f78e95fdb8583e08de9093b1050aa95a1d1705fcb00c9fcb17338bcd7caa619f-image.png" width="60% " />

3. Select the required users and click **Done**. The selected users can now access the board based on their permissions.

You can also copy the link and share the board. However, the user must have the required access to the board.

#### Shared Access Types

There are three levels of access:

* **Owner**: Full permissions to edit tiles, manage users, and delete the board.
* **Editor**: Full permissions similar to Owner, except they cannot remove the Owner.
* **Viewer**: Can view the board but cannot make changes.

#### Access Methods

There are two ways to assign access:

* **Individual Access**: The Owner or Editor manually adds users via email and assigns them _Editor_ or _Viewer_ access.
* **General Access**: The board can be set as _Anyone can View_ or _Anyone can Edit_, granting all users in the account that level of access.

> 📘 Note
>
> Both access types can coexist. For example, a board marked as General View can be visible to all users, while a few power users are assigned Individual Edit access to this board. In such cases, individual access overrides general access.

### Clone

This option is used when you want to track the same metrics with minor changes. Anyone who has access to your project can clone the board by clicking the three-dot menu at the top of the board and then selecting **Clone** from the list.

### Rename

You can rename the board clicking the three-dot menu at the top of the board and then selecting **Rename** from the list.

### Delete

### Sort

You can sort the boards by the date they were created and by the person who created them. To do so, click the column header.

### Search
