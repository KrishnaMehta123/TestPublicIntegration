# Overview

# What is NPS?

NPS is an acronym for Net Promoter Score. It is a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement that asks customers how likely they are to recommend your product or service to others on a scale of 0 to 10.

Aggregating NPS scores helps businesses gauge customer satisfaction and improve service, customer support, delivery, etc., to increase customer loyalty. 

CleverTap's Net Promoter Score (_NPS_) dashboard provides a detailed view of the overall NPS feedback received from your customers. To view the NPS dashboard, navigate to _Dashboard_ > _Boards_ > _NPS_.  

# NPS Board

The NPS board represents the following data points:

- Overall _NPS score_ 
- _Total responses received_ from the customers

The overall _NPS score_  is calculated as the difference between the percentages of Promoters and Detractors (NPS = % of Promoters - % of Detractors). 

At a high level, the NPS feedback for a question is categorized into three buckets - Detractors, Passive, and Promoters. 

On a scale of 0-10 :

- A Detractor is anybody who gives a score between 0-6.
- Passive is anybody who gives a score of 7 or 8.
- Promoter is anybody who gives a score of 9 or 10.

Let us understand this with an example. For a standard NPS question, "How likely are you to recommend us on a scale from 0 to 10?” If 70% of respondents are Promoters and 10% are Detractors, then you have an NPS of 60.

You can filter the data by campaigns or using the date filter. 

Refer to the following bar chart representing data for respective NPS buckets of Detractors, Passives, and Promoters.
