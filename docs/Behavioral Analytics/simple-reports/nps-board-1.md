# Overview

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used metric for measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction. It is based on a single question that asks customers how likely they are to recommend your product or service to others on a scale of 0 to 10.

By aggregating NPS scores over time, businesses can gauge overall customer sentiment and identify opportunities to improve areas such as product experience, customer support, and service delivery—ultimately strengthening customer loyalty.

CleverTap’s NPS dashboard gives you a clear and comprehensive view of your customers’ NPS feedback. To access it, go to _Dashboard_ > _Boards_ > _NPS_.

# NPS AI Insights

NPS AI Insights is an enhancement to CleverTap’s Net Promoter Score (NPS) dashboard. It combines quantitative data (such as NPS scores and response volumes) with qualitative insights (including AI summaries, sentiment analysis, and theme clustering).

In addition to standard NPS metrics, NPS AI Insights applies AI-powered analysis to free-text responses, helping you quickly interpret customer feedback. This gives marketers and product teams a more complete view of customer satisfaction and the key factors influencing it.

# NPS Board - Stats

The **NPS board** in CleverTap provides a comprehensive overview of customer feedback collected through Net Promoter Score surveys. It combines key quantitative metrics with trend visualizations to help you measure and track user sentiment over time.

The NPS board in CleverTap displays the following data points:

- **Overall NPS Score:** Calculated using customer responses.
- **Total Responses Received:** Number of users who submitted feedback.
- **NPS Buckets:** Categorized breakdown of Detractors, Passives, and Promoters.
- **NPS Score Trend:** Visual representation of how the score changes over time.
- **NPS Buckets Trend:** Distribution of Detractors, Passives, and Promoters over a selected time period (daily, weekly, or monthly).
- **Ratings Distribution:** Bar chart of user ratings on a scale of 0–10.
- **Total Responses Trend:** Trend line showing submission volumes across time periods.

At a high level, the NPS feedback is categorized into three buckets - Detractors, Passive, and Promoters.

- **Detractors (0–6):** Unhappy customers likely to churn or share negative feedback.
- **Passives (7–8):** Neutral customers who are satisfied but not enthusiastic.
- **Promoters (9–10):** Loyal customers who are highly likely to recommend your product.

The overall _NPS score_  is calculated as the difference between the percentages of Promoters and Detractors (NPS = % of Promoters - % of Detractors). For example, for a standard NPS question, "How likely are you to recommend us on a scale from 0 to 10?” If 70% of respondents are Promoters and 10% are Detractors, then you have an NPS of 60. You can refine your view using filters for **campaigns**, **segments**, or **date ranges** to analyze performance for specific cohorts or time periods.

The following chart illustrates how feedback is distributed across Detractors, Passives, and Promoters:
