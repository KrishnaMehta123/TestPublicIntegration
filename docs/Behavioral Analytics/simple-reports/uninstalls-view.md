# Overview

The *Uninstall* dashboard presents data on the number of users uninstalling your app, the number of new activations (first-time app launches), and the net number of new installs (new installs and total uninstalls for specific date ranges).

# Troubleshooting and FAQ

### Q. Why are most of my uninstalls tracked between 2 AM and 4 AM?

CleverTap runs a daily task at 2 AM (local time) to detect the number of uninstalls. You can account for this time to create campaigns and journeys to retain these users.
