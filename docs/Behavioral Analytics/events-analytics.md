# Overview

This section covers how to analyze an event and its various components. Analyzing events provides the capability to understand your audience's behavior on a comprehensive level, whether you want to view which countries use your app the most to what hours of the day they might stream a show. 

# Analyze an Event

To analyze an event, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to *Analytics* > *Events*. 
2. Filter by segments and select the event. 
3. If required, filter further by segment behavior. 
4. Click **View details**.

## Trends and Properties

In the *Trend and Properties* tab, you can analyze the events and people on a daily, weekly, and monthly duration.

In addition, you can further evaluate the selected event by its property and also view the frequency histogram chart for the same event.

## Session

We divide a 24-hour day cycle into 12 buckets of two hours each. The event is analyzed by the time of the day based on these two-hour divisions. 

Here is an example of viewing Sessions for the *Charged* event:

* *By time of the day*: Displays the distribution of user events across different times of the day. For example, it can show the number of users active during morning hours, afternoon hours, or evening hours.
* *By minutes before charged*: Displays the duration between the initiation of a user session and the moment they finalize a purchase or successfully complete a transaction. This metric can help businesses understand how long it takes for users to convert, which in turn can help them optimize their user experience and marketing strategies.
* *Pages before charged*: Displays the number of pages a user visits before making a purchase or completing a transaction. This metric can help businesses understand the user journey on their app or website and identify any potential roadblocks or issues that may prevent users from converting.

## Geography

The event data is displayed by cities, regions, and countries.
