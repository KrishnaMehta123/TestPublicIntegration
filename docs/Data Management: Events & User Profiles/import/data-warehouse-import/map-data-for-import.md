# Overview

After [configuring import](doc:create-import), this step lets you map your data warehouse columns to CleverTap’s user profiles or events. This ensures each row of data updates the correct fields in CleverTap.

* [**User Profile Data**](doc:map-data-for-import#user-profile-data): Map user-specific fields such as `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, or any other attribute from the database, to the user profile fields in CleverTap.
* [**Event Properties**](doc:map-data-for-import#event-data): Map event-specific columns such as `add_to_cart`, `product_viewed`, `purchased` to CleverTap event properties.

Use the toggle to switch between User Profile Data and Event Data mapping options.

# User Profile Data

Configure how user data is mapped and imported from the data warehouse into CleverTap. This step ensures that user profiles are correctly identified, updated, and enriched with relevant attributes.

<Image align="center" alt="User Profile Data" border={true} caption="User Profile Data" src="https://files.readme.io/d1d1ea0c76ba66d3c3b4cb6ef1ad073b88b9324056fc8cbd9f4db557c837bc38-User_Profile_Data.png" />

The mapping process consists of the following three steps:

1. [Map identity](doc:map-data-for-import#map-identity)  to specify how incoming user records from data warehouses are matched to user profiles in CleverTap.
2. [Select a timestamp column](doc:map-data-for-import#define-updated-on-timestamp) to fetch only newly added or updated records.
3. [Map Snowflake columns](doc:map-data-for-import#map-user-profile-properties) to CleverTap user properties.

## Map Identity

This step specifies how incoming user records from data warehouses are matched to user profiles in CleverTap, using either a unique identity field (such as email, phone number, or user ID) or the system-generated CleverTap ID.

* **[Identity](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles#identifiers)**: A unique user identifier, such as email, phone number, or custom ID, used to match profiles in CleverTap. The maximum length allowed is 1024 characters. When using Identity:
  * If a profile with the same identity exists, CleverTap updates or adds properties to the existing profile.
  * If a matching profile does not exist, CleverTap creates a new profile and generates a corresponding CleverTap ID.
* **[CleverTap ID](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles#identifiers)**: A system-generated unique identifier assigned to each user profile in CleverTap. The maximum length allowed is 1024 characters. When using CleverTap ID:
  * The ID must be provided when updating the profile.
  * If a profile with the same ID exists, CleverTap updates or adds properties to it.

<Callout icon="🚧" theme="warn">
  #### Identity Field Validation Rules

  * Identity/CleverTap ID values cannot be: `undefined`, `null`, `na`, `n/a`, `0`, `nil`, `-1`, `infinity`, `-infinity`, `inf`, `-inf`, `nan`, `-nan`, `empty`, or `xxxxxx`.
  * Values exceeding 1024 characters will be marked as errors.
</Callout>

## Define Updated On Timestamp

Define the **Updated On** field to ensure CleverTap imports only new or updated rows since the last sync, optimizing performance and avoiding duplicate processing.

1. **Select a Timestamp Column**  
   Select a column that tracks when each row was added or updated. The following column types are supported:
   * `NUMERIC`
   * `DATE`
   * `TIMESTAMP`
   * `TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE`

2. **Configure the Date Format**  
   Specify how CleverTap should interpret the timestamp values:

   * If the column type is `NUMERIC`, choose one of the following:
     * **Epoch Seconds** – 10-digit timestamps (for example, `1640995200`)
     * **Epoch Milliseconds** – 13-digit timestamps (e.g., `1640995200000`)

   * If the column type is `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, or `TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE`, CleverTap automatically detects and processes the format, without requiring a format selection.

## Map User Profile Properties

This step maps data warehouse columns to CleverTap user properties, ensuring seamless data import and accurate user profile updates. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. **Select a Column**  
   Choose a column from your database that contains user-related information, such as `email`, `name`, `Customer Type`, or `Wallet Balance`.

2. **Assign a User Property**  
   Map the selected column to a corresponding CleverTap user property.

   * Select from available system properties (for example, `email_id` maps to _Email_).
   * If the desired property isn’t listed, enter a new name to create a custom property.

> 📘 **System Properties**
>
> * Predefined properties like Email and Phone have fixed data types and validation rules. For more information, refer to [System User Properties](doc:user-profiles#system-user-properties).
> * **Validation Rules:**
>   * **Phone**: Must start with `+` and contain more than four digits
>   * **MSG Properties** (e.g., MSG-Email, MSG-SMS): Accepts only `"0"`, `"1"`, `"true"`, or `"false"`
>   * **Property Names**: Cannot include these characters: `%`, `>`, `<`, `!`, `|`, `&`, `.`, `:`, `;`, `$`, `'`, `"`, `\`, `#`

3. **Choose a Data Type**  
   Select the appropriate data type for the column. Use the table below to determine when and how each type should be used:

| **Data Type** | **When to Select**                           | **Example Values**                                   | Validation                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **String**    | Text values such as names, emails, or labels | `"John Doe"`, `"john@example.com"`, `"Premium User"` | No validation                                                                                                                                     |
| **Integer**   | Whole numbers, such as age or counts         | `30`, `120`, `500`                                   | Must be numeric                                                                                                                                   |
| **Float**     | Decimals such as ratings or prices           | `4.7`, `99.99`, `15.5`                               | Must be numeric                                                                                                                                   |
| **Long**      | Large whole numbers such as IDs              | `9876543210`, `123456789012345`                      | Must be numeric                                                                                                                                   |
| **Boolean**   | True/false flags                             | `true`, `false`                                      | Only accepts: "0", "1", "true", "false"                                                                                                           |
| **Date**      | Timestamps such as the signup or login date  | `2024-03-18`, `18/03/2024`, `03/18/2024`             | Must match selected date format. For more information, refer to [Supported Date Format](doc:map-data-for-snowflake-import#supported-date-format). |

# Event Data

Configure how event data is mapped and imported from the data warehouse into CleverTap. This setup ensures event records are accurately linked to user profiles, timestamped correctly, and enriched with event-specific properties.

<Image align="center" alt="Event Data" border={true} caption="Event Data" src="https://files.readme.io/80338755cccb4898f5cf092170a96ffcde306da1e9a0f6e54a2e17568a81a04b-Event_Data.png" />

The mapping process consists of the following five steps:

1. [Map identity](doc:map-data-for-import#map-identity-1) to associate event data with user profiles in CleverTap.
2. [Select a timestamp column](doc:map-data-for-import#define-updated-on-timestamp-1) to fetch only newly added or updated rows.
3. [Define when each event occurred](doc:map-data-for-import#map-created-on-timestamp)  using a created-on timestamp.
4. [Choose how events are named](doc:map-data-for-import#choose-event-naming-method) (from a column or a static value).
5. [Map Snowflake columns to CleverTap event properties](doc:map-data-for-import#map-event-properties).

## Map Identity

This step specifies how incoming event records from the data warehouse are matched to user profiles in CleverTap using either a unique identity field (for example, email, phone, or user ID) or the system-generated CleverTap ID.

* **[Identity](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles#identifiers)**: Matches events to user profiles using a unique field. The maximum length allowed is 1024 characters.
* **[CleverTap ID](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles#identifiers)**: Matches records using CleverTap’s system-generated ID.

> 🚧 **Identity Field Validation Rules**
>
> * Disallowed values: `undefined`, `null`, `na`, `n/a`, `0`, `nil`, `-1`, `infinity`, `-infinity`, `inf`, `-inf`, `nan`, `-nan`, `empty`, `xxxxxx`
> * Values exceeding 1024 characters are marked as errors.

## Define Updated On Timestamp

This field ensures CleverTap imports only newly added or updated event records since the last sync.

1. **Select a Timestamp Column**  
   Choose a column that indicates when a row was last added or updated. Supported types:
   * `NUMERIC`
   * `DATE`
   * `TIMESTAMP`
   * `TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE`

2. **Configure the Date Format**
   * If the column type is `NUMERIC`, choose:
     * **Epoch Seconds** (for example, `1640995200`)
     * **Epoch Milliseconds** (for example, `1640995200000`)
   * If the column type is **DATE**, **TIMESTAMP**, or **TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE**, CleverTap automatically processes the timestamp without requiring a format selection.

## Map Created On Timestamp

Use this field to track when each event occurred.

* **Select Column**: Choose the column containing event timestamps.
* **Date Format**: Select the format used in the timestamp.

For more information, refer to [Supported Date Format](doc:map-data-for-snowflake-import#supported-date-format).

> 📘 Validation Rules for Timestamp
>
> * If this field is not mapped, CleverTap uses the current account timestamp to store the event data against the user profile.
> * Invalid formats or data types will cause import errors.

## Choose Event Naming Method

Specify how CleverTap should assign names to imported events.

* **Event from Column**  
  Import different event types using a column that contains event names. Ideal for dynamic event tables.

* **Specific Event**  
  Assign a single static event name for all imported records. Best for importing a consistent event type.

> 📘 Validations Rules for Event Naming
>
> * Event names must not include: `%`, `>`, `<`, `!`, `|`, `&`, `.`, `:`, `;`, `$`, `'`, `"`, `\`, `#`
> * System events cannot be imported or processed.

## Map Event Properties

This step maps columns to CleverTap event properties, providing context and detail to each event.

1. **Select a Column**  
   Choose a column with event-related details like `category`, `price`, or `transactionID`.

2. **Enter Event Property**  
   Assign a name for the corresponding CleverTap event property.

You can use existing property names or enter new ones to create custom event properties.

> 📘 Points to Remember
>
> * System event properties and `Charged: Item|Properties` cannot be imported.
> * Event property names must not contain: `%`, `>`, `<`, `!`, `|`, `&`, `.`, `:`, `;`, `$`, `'`, `"`, `\`, `#`

3. **Select Data Type**  
   Choose the appropriate data type based on your column values:

| **Data Type** | **When to Select**                            | **Example Values**          | **Validation**                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **String**    | Text values such as category or customer type | `"Jeans"`, `"Premium User"` | No validation                                                                                                                                 |
| **Integer**   | Whole numbers such as item count or balance   | `30`, `500`                 | Must be numeric                                                                                                                               |
| **Float**     | Decimal values such as price or discount      | `4.7`, `99.99`              | Must be numeric                                                                                                                               |
| **Long**      | Large integers such as transaction IDs        | `123456789012345`           | Must be numeric                                                                                                                               |
| **Boolean**   | Binary flags such as order status             | `true`, `false`, `0`, `1`   | Only accepts: "0", "1", "true", "false"                                                                                                       |
| **Date**      | Timestamps such as event or checkout time     | `2024-03-18`, `03/18/2024`  | Must match supported format. For more information, refer to [Supported Date Format](doc:map-data-for-snowflake-import#supported-date-format). |

# Supported Date Format

If the selected column is of `Date` datatype, then you do not need to provide the date format. You can select from the following date format patterns when mapping `Date` type fields:

| **Format Type**      | **Example Format**                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Epoch (Seconds)      | 10-digit number (for example, `1640995200`)                                                                        |
| Epoch (Milliseconds) | 13-digit number (for example, `1640995200000`)                                                                     |
| Date-Time Formats    | `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss`, `MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss`, `yyyy/dd/MM HH:mm:ss`, `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss`, `dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss` |
| Date Only Formats    | `dd/MM/yyyy`, `MM/dd/yyyy`, `yyyy/dd/MM`, `yyyy/MM/dd`, `ddMMMyyyy`                                                |

# Perform Dry Run (Recommended)

After completing your mapping configuration, CleverTap strongly recommends performing a Dry Run to simulate the import and validate your settings, without affecting your CleverTap account. This step helps identify potential errors early and ensures your mapping is accurate.

Click **Perform Dry Run** after completing your mapping configuration. CleverTap will do the following:

1. Connects to the database of your data warehouse.
2. Retrieve random samples from your mapped data.
3. Validates the configuration as follows:
   * Mapping accuracy and configuration.
   * Data type compatibility.
   * Field validation requirements.
   * Potential errors or conflicts.
4. Displays results with detailed feedback.

## Dry Run Results

The dry run results display comprehensive information about your mapping validation:

| Column                 | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Result**             | Shows validation status (Success/Error) and specific details about the mapping validation.                  |
| **Database Nickname**  | Displays the nickname of your database being used for import.                                               |
| **CleverTap Property** | Shows the corresponding CleverTap property (user profile or event property) mapped from the data warehouse. |
| **Data Type**          | Indicates the data type of the mapped property in CleverTap (String, Integer, Date, etc.).                  |

## Validation Outcomes

After mapping data fields from the data warehouse to CleverTap, the system runs a validation check to assess configuration accuracy, data quality, and identity alignment. The outcomes are categorized as follows:

* **Successful Validation**: Indicates that the mapping and sample records meet CleverTap’s data structure and formatting requirements.
  * User profile data or event data from your data warehouse's database was validated successfully.
  * Random sample records processed without errors.
  * Mapping configuration confirmed as accurate.
  * Data types are properly aligned between your data warehouse and CleverTap.
* **Error Detection**: Indicates that the mapping contains issues that must be resolved before proceeding with the import.
  * Invalid data types or formatting issues.
  * Identity/CleverTap ID validation failures.
  * System property validation errors (Email, Phone format issues).
  * Prohibited characters in property names or event names.
  * Date format mismatches.
* **Interpreting Results**: Use the visual indicators to understand the outcome of your validation and take the appropriate next steps.
  * **Green (Success)**: Mapping is correctly configured and ready for import.
  * **Red (Error)**: Mapping must be corrected before proceeding with import.

## Sync User Profile and Event Data (Optional)

Syncing user profiles and event data allows you to push the selected random data from the data warehouse's database to CleverTap. For user profiles and events, if the profile is not present in CleverTap, a new profile is created, and user properties are captured against this profile.

> 🚧 Event Data Sync During Dry Run
>
> When performing the dry run of event data, syncing may result in duplicate events. To maintain data integrity, avoid syncing events unless absolutely necessary.

# Best Practices for Mapping

When configuring import mapping in CleverTap, keep the following best practices and tips in mind to make the most of these features:

* **Validate Data Upfront**: Clean and verify your source data before import. For example, ensure Email addresses are well-formed and active to avoid future bounces. Check phone numbers and dates to avoid errors during the Dry Run.
* **Use Incremental Timestamps**: Always map an “updated at” or timestamp column to "UPDATED ON" so you can do incremental updates.
* **Consistent Formats**: Keep date and time formats uniform in your selected data warehouse. If you choose Date type, ensure the column’s format (YYYY-MM-DD, etc.) matches what you set in CleverTap. Inconsistent formats will cause parsing errors.
* **Leverage Dry Runs**: Always run the Dry Run feature before the actual import. This is like previewing a snowball before throwing it – it catches mapping issues so you can fix them without affecting live data.
* **Limit Data to What’s Needed**: Import only the columns you use in CleverTap. Avoid mapping extraneous fields or properties. This makes the process faster and reduces risk.
* **Upload Anonymous Profiles**: Use the Device ID as the CleverTap ID to upload anonymous user data to CleverTap.
* **Security and Access**: Use a dedicated data warehouse user with minimal permissions for the integration. Grant only read access to the tables/columns you need.
* **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent names for properties and events. Avoid special characters in property keys (CleverTap does not allow the following characters: `%`, `<`, `>`, `!`, `|`, `&`, `:`, `;`, `$`, `'`, `"`, `\`, `#`). If needed, map such keys to valid property names in CleverTap.
* **Segmentation of Data**: Consider filtering your data warehouse data to exclude obsolete or inactive users/events before import. This keeps your CleverTap instance clean and focused on relevant customers.

By understanding these options and best practices, you can ensure your data warehouse-to-CleverTap imports run smoothly and keep your customer data accurate and up-to-date.

In the next step, **Schedule** the import by choosing **Repeat Intervals**, or a **Custom Schedule**, or opting for **Manual Triggering**. For detailed instructions, refer to [Schedule Import](doc:schedule-import).
