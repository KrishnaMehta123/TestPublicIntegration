# Overview

**Schedule an Import** enables you to control how often data is imported from your database into CleverTap. By configuring a schedule, you ensure your CleverTap data stays up-to-date with the warehouse, aligning with your operational and analytical needs. This document covers the following three scheduling options and how to configure each, along with their ideal use cases and best practices:e

* [**Repeat Intervals**](doc:schedule-import#repeat-intervals): Configure automated recurring imports at defined intervals (for example, every _N_ minutes, hours, or days) to ensure continuous and consistent data synchronization.
* [**Custom Schedule**](doc:schedule-import#custom-schedule): Schedule imports on specific days of the week or specific dates of the month to align with weekly or monthly cycles.
* [**Manually Trigger**](doc:frequency#manually-trigger): Run imports on demand, either immediately, at a specified future date, or without a schedule for manual triggering when needed.

Regardless of the selected schedule, the initial import retrieves all available records. Subsequent imports fetch only the new or updated records since the previous run.

# Repeat Intervals

Select this option to configure automatic imports at fixed intervals, helping maintain regular data synchronization without manual intervention. This approach is ideal for frequently updated data, such as user attributes or events that may change hourly or daily. You can specify the import frequency in minutes, hours, days, or weeks to align with your data refresh schedule.

Once scheduled, the first import **runs immediately**, ingesting all records from the database into CleverTap. After this initial import, each subsequent run executes at the defined interval and pulls only the new or updated information since the last run (also called incremental sync). For example, if the import is set to run every 6 hours, the first run happens immediately, and then every 6 hours, the import fetches only the changes made since the previous run.

> 📘 Minimum Repeat Interval for Higher Frequency Imports
>
> The minimum repeat interval allowed is **15 minutes**. This limit ensures performance and avoids overloading the system. If you require more frequent imports than 15 minutes, contact CleverTap support to discuss options.

## Configure Repeat Intervals

To configure the import to run at repeat intervals, perform the following steps:

1. Select _Repeat Intervals_ as the schedule type under _Frequency Settings_.
2. Enter the repeat frequency: Enter a number and choose the time unit (Minutes, Hours, Days, or Weeks) from the dropdown to define how often the import should run. For example, you might enter “6” and select “Hours” for an import every 6 hours.
3. Click **Import** to save the schedule. CleverTap immediately runs the first import and then continues to execute the subsequent runs at the specified interval.

This option is ideal when you want hands-free, regular updates. It ensures your CleverTap data is periodically refreshed. A best practice is to align the interval with your data update frequency. For instance, if your data warehouse's data is updated once a day, a daily import interval (or slightly after the update time) is sufficient and avoids unnecessary runs.

# Custom Schedule

Use **Custom Schedule** to set up recurring imports on specific days of the week or specific dates of the month. This option gives you finer control over scheduling, which is useful if your data updates or business processes happen on particular days (for example, weekly reports on Mondays, or a monthly refresh on the 1st of each month). By customizing the schedule, you can align data imports with your reporting cycles or other events in your organization calendar.

In Custom Schedule, you have the following two modes:

* **Day of the Week**: Schedule imports on specific weekdays at designated times. For example, you want the import to run every **Monday and Thursday at 10:00 AM** to coincide with weekly analysis or prepare data for a Monday morning report and a mid-week check-in. This ensures data is synced at the beginning and mid-point of the week.
* **Day of the Month**: Schedule monthly imports for regular reporting or billing updates. For example, you might schedule an import on the 1st of every month at 9:00 AM to capture mid-month and end-of-month data updates.

## Configure Custom Schedule

To schedule an import for the day of the week, perform the following steps:

1. Select _Custom Schedule_ and select either _Day of Week_ or _Day of Month_.
2. For Day of Week, toggle the desired weekdays (for example, Monday, Thursday). For Day of Month, select the calendar date(s) (for example, 1st, 15th, last day of the month).
3. Set the time for each selected day or date. Add multiple schedules if needed.
4. Click **Import** to save the monthly schedule. The import runs at the specified time on the next occurrence of each selected date every month.

# Manually Trigger

The **Manually Trigger** option gives you complete control over when your data import runs, without setting up a recurring schedule. Use this option when you need a one-time import, such as an urgent data backfill, a sync scheduled for a specific future time, or an import that you want to trigger manually as part of an external workflow.

Unlike Repeat or Custom schedules, manual imports do not recur automatically. Instead, you can choose from the following three manual trigger modes:

* **Run Immediately**
* Run on a Specific Date
* Run Later

## Run Immediately

Choose **Run Immediately** to start the import process immediately after you finish configuring the import. This is helpful for one-time or urgent imports where you want to ingest the data without delay. For example, after setting up a new import, you want to bring in the initial dataset now rather than wait. When you select this option and click **Import**, CleverTap immediately queues and executes the import job.

After the import runs, the job is listed under the **Import Listing** page in a **Ready** state. This indicates that the import configuration is saved, and you can manually trigger the import again at any time. The first run imports all available records, while any subsequent runs fetch only records updated since the last execution, following the standard incremental update behavior.

## Run on a Specific Date

Choose **Run on a Specific Date** to schedule a one-time import at a future date and time. Use this option when you need fresh data at a specific moment, for example, syncing a new batch of data before a major campaign launch. You can also use it to set up an import in advance if you plan to start regular imports later; configure everything now and schedule the first run for a future date, switching to a recurring schedule afterward if needed.

When configuring this option, select the exact date and time for the import. The import remains in a scheduled state until the specified time and execute once. After the run completes, the import appears on the _Import Listing_ page in a **Ready** state, similar to the Run Immediately behavior. From there, you can manually trigger future runs as needed, but the import does not automatically recur unless reconfigured.

## Run Later

Choose **Run Later** to configure the import now without immediately executing it. When you select this option and click **Import**, the import configuration is created and listed in a **Ready** state on the _Import Listing_ page, but no import is triggered automatically. You can manually run the import at any time by clicking **Run**.

This option is ideal when you want the import setup ready but are unsure when the data will be available or when you want to execute it. For example, you might prepare an import for an upcoming data migration and only run it after the migration is complete.

Until the first manual run occurs, the import remains in the **Ready** state with no data ingested. Once triggered, the initial run imports all available records (full import). Subsequent manual runs continue to fetch only new or updated records since the previous execution.

<Image align="center" alt="Manual Trigger - Run Later" border={true} caption="Manual Trigger - Run Later" src="https://files.readme.io/5c5f6b6f7eef9f360b140db824f4ad294bf609d0e5a7e4dba16fa7a08809864d-run_later_-_schedule_.png" />

> 📘 Manual Imports: Behavior and Reusability
>
> All manual trigger options initiate imports that remain in a **Ready** state after execution, allowing them to be re-run when needed. You can return to the import list at any time and select **Run** to execute the import again. These imports do not run on a recurring schedule unless explicitly configured.
>
> As with scheduled imports, the initial run will import all available data. Subsequent runs will only import new or modified records to prevent duplication.

## Configure Manual Trigger

To configure a manual trigger, perform the following steps:

1. Select _Manual Trigger_ and select from the following options:
   * **Run Immediately**: Select this to execute the import right away. Click Import to begin.
   * **Run on a specific date**: Pick a date and time, then click Import. The job will execute automatically at the specified time.
   * **Run later**: Save the configuration without scheduling a run. You can manually trigger the import from the Import Listing page by clicking **Run**.
2. Click **Import** to save the configuration.

# Best Practices for Scheduling

When configuring your import schedules in CleverTap, keep the following best practices and tips in mind to make the most of these features:

* **Align with Data Updates**: Schedule imports shortly after your source data is refreshed. For example, if your data warehouse loads new data at 2 AM, schedule the import at 3 AM to capture the latest records. Avoid scheduling too early, as importing stale data can result in redundant or empty syncs.
* **Choose the Right Frequency**: Use the Repeat Intervals option only as frequently as necessary. While CleverTap allows intervals in minutes, hours, days, or weeks, running very frequent imports (for example, every 15 minutes) might not be needed if your data does not change that often. Remember, 15 minutes is the minimum interval allowed. Many platforms set this limit to balance freshness with performance overhead. If you truly need quicker updates (near real-time), consider using CleverTap APIs or contact support to discuss solutions rather than scheduling an unrealistic import frequency.
* **Monitor Import Duration**: Track how long each import run takes, especially for large data sets. If your import takes nearly as long as the interval itself, you might end up with overlapping or continuous-running jobs. CleverTap will queue the next run, but it is wise to ensure the interval gives enough buffer. If you notice overlapping, you might increase the interval or switch to a different schedule strategy (or investigate whether you can reduce the data volume per import).
* **Use Incremental Data Columns**: CleverTap automatically pulls incremental data after the first run. To facilitate this, ensure your data warehouse table has a reliable way to identify new or updated records (for example, an **updated_at** timestamp). Having such a column and keeping it updated whenever a row changes is crucial. **Do not reuse or reset this timestamp to older values** – always move it forward (monotonically increasing). This practice ensures no updates are missed and prevents race conditions where a record might not be picked up because its update time fell outside the expected window.
* **Avoid Mid-Run Data Changes**: Try not to update or insert a large batch of new data during an ongoing import run. If data is being altered while an import query is running, some records might get skipped or partially updated due to timing (this is a general caution for any data integration process). If you need to perform a big update in your warehouse, it might be wise to pause the schedule (or use a manual trigger) and then run an import after the update is complete.
* **Leverage Manual Triggers for Flexibility**: If your data sync needs do not neatly fit a recurring schedule, use the manual options. For example, you might normally run weekly but occasionally need an extra mid-week import. You can go to the import listing and click Run for an on-demand sync. This will not affect the regular schedule (if one is set) and allows you to get data when needed.
* **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your import schedules. Business needs can change – maybe you set a daily import but later realize weekly is enough (or vice versa). It is easy to edit the schedule of an existing import or create a new one with a different frequency. Also, if an import job is no longer needed (for example, if you stopped using a particular dataset), it is best practice to stop that import schedule to reduce unnecessary load.

By applying these options and best practices, you can optimize data imports into CleverTap to fit your operational needs. Choose a repeat interval for ongoing updates, customize schedules for more flexibility, or use manual triggers for complete control. Aligning your import strategy with your data availability and business processes ensures you always have the latest information in CleverTap, with minimal manual effort.
