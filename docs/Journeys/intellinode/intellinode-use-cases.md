# Overview

IntelliNODE is a clever system designed to provide your business with the benefit of optimum engagement and retention. IntelliNODE has a wide variety of industry applications. You can experiment with the messaging order, content, channel, timing, and frequency.

Following are the cases where leading different industries are solving their most interesting problems. Use the below sample use cases to exceed customer expectations and increase ROI.

## FinTech

The Fintech industry has its own unique set of challenges with customer engagement and retention. While you focus on innovation and service for your customers, we can help you automate and fulfill your engagement needs.

Following are the use cases where you can test your approach:

<details>
  <summary><span class="bold"> High drop off during the know your customer (KYC) process.</span></summary>

### High drop off during the *know your customer* (KYC) process

KYC is a mandatory step before the user can make any worthwhile transactions on the application.  A high drop-off at this stage means a wasted acquisition.  

### Purpose

Find out the time of the day when the users are most likely to complete KYC.

### Assumptions

Users are more likely to complete KYC registration if they are engaged at a specific time.

### Experiment

Use IntelliNODE to set up different experiments to engage users at different times. If this is a weekday journey, create multiple paths to engage users based on before, during, and after office hours. Given that office hours are from 10.00 AM to 6:00 PM, create four different paths to send a push message at 8.30 AM, 2.30 PM, 6.30 PM, and 8.30 PM.

  <summary><span class="bold"> Best channel for sending coupon codes to incentivize users </span></summary>

### Coupon Codes for Users

You can have higher app launches and more engagement and purchases if the users are incentivized with discounts. 

#### Purpose

Make an informed decision to select two of the following channels: SMS, Email, or WhatsApp.

#### Assumption

Users are more likely to use coupon codes from WhatsApp. A reminder from Email or SMS can be beneficial. 

#### Experiment

Use IntelliNODE to experiment with a combination of two channels. Use the experiments for a cost-benefit analysis of the channels. For example, create three IntelliNODE paths:

* **Path A**: SMS + Email
* **Path B**: WhatsApp + Email
* **Path C**: SMS + WhatsApp

### Select the order of the messaging channel

Which is the best messaging order to inform users about a debit in their account? 

#### Purpose

Find out an order of messaging that balances speed and reach.

#### Assumption

The combination of messaging channels must have the highest reach.

#### Experiment

Create different paths with IntelliNODE and find the best messaging order between Push, SMS, and Email. For example, create six paths:

* **Path A**: Push > Email > SMS
* **Path B**: Push > SMS > Email
* **Path C**: Email > Push > SMS
* **Path D**: Email > SMS > Push
* **Path E**: SMS > Push > Email

### Schedule stock market news based on views

Do my users read investment news before the stock market opens or after it closes?

#### Purpose

Select the time to engage your users.

#### Assumption

The following are the assumptions:

* Articles about the long-term view of the market are most read after market hours.
* News about global indices is read before market hours.

#### Experiment

Create different journeys for different times of the day. You can also experiment with different days of the week. For example, compare weekdays and weekends. You can run these two experiments simultaneously with two IntelliNODEs. 

Create the following push paths: 

*IntelliNODE 1 (Runs on weekdays only)*

* 8.30 AM - Long-term view articles 
* 8.30 AM - Global Indices News 
* 7.30 PM - Long-term view articles
* 7.30 PM - Global Indices

## E-commerce

While E-commerce is a buzzword today, it is also a challenging business to be in. The cost of customer acquisition and logistics, added to the high drop-off rates, is an interesting problem to solve. Customers today are more likely to buy from businesses that deliver a personalized experience.
CleverTap has collated various use cases from players in this industry with similar challenges and how IntelliNODE is helping them win. 

Following are the use cases where you can test your approach:

<details>
  <summary><span class="bold"> Users drop-off after adding an item to cart.</span></summary>

Find the ideal time to engage with users to help them complete the purchase.

#### Purpose

Find out the message delay required to persuade users to complete the purchase.  

#### Assumption

Users will likely purchase within two hours of adding an item to the cart.

#### Experiment

Set up different experiments to engage users at different delays. Set up multiple IntelliNODE paths to engage the user within the specified duration of the event. Set up paths for the first 15 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, and two hours after the user abandons the cart.

Following are the use cases where you can test your approach:

<details>
  <summary><span class="bold">Users do not engage with messages about new movie releases</span></summary>

### Users do not engage with messages about new movie releases

Users do not click on the push messages that are sent to promote new movies. The viewership for new movies is low. 

#### Purpose

Find out the time of the day when the users are most likely to engage with the messages.

#### Assumption

Sending push notifications during evening hours can increase conversion and help boost views.

#### Experiment

Create an IntelliNODE with paths that engage users at different times, such as:

#### Assumption

The assumption is that the mobile Push, followed by Email and SMS, decreases the user drop-off rate.

#### Experiment

Use IntelliNODE to experiment to select the optimum combination of channels. Additionally, you can compare engagement costs for these channels too and drop the most expensive channel from the mix.\
Create different paths with IntelliNODE and find the best messaging order between Push, SMS, and Email. For example, create six paths:

* **Path A**: Push > Email > SMS
* **Path B**: Push > SMS > Email
* **Path C**: Email > Push > SMS

  <summary><span class="bold"> Constantly nudging users to convert from AVOD to SVOD users may cause them to unsubscribe</span>
</summary>

### Constant nudges for SVOD cause user unsubscribes

Constantly nudging users to convert from  Advertising-based Video On Demand (AVOD) to Subscription Video On Demand (SVOD) may cause them to unsubscribe from Push, Email, or WhatsApp channels.

#### Purpose

The purpose is to identify how many nudges are too many that may cause a user to unsubscribe. Find out the maximum number of nudges suitable without causing unsubscribes.

#### Assumption

Too many nudges will drive users to unsubscribe, and too few nudges will not drive them to convert.

* **Path A**: Two push messages
* **Path B**: Three push messages
