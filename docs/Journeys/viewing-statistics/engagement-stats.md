# Overview

Engagement Stats provide a unified view of how each messaging node performs across all versions of a journey, helping marketers make data-driven decisions.

For instance, a lifecycle marketing team may iterate on a welcome journey to improve user onboarding, testing different message sequences, timings, or channels in each version. With Engagement Stats, they can easily evaluate how each version performs in terms of overall engagement, delivery, and conversions, helping them identify the most effective strategy and continuously optimize user experiences across the funnel.

# View Engagement Stats

To view engagement stats:

1. Go to **Journeys**. Click the desired Journey and click **Engagement Stats**.
2. Select the version from the Version dropdown to view the stats for the specific version of the Journey.

## Edit Columns

While the table layout is fixed by default, you can still sort and filter the data to focus on the metrics that matter most. To sort and manage the engagement data effectively, perform the following steps:

1. Click <Image border={false} src="https://files.readme.io/f68f358198ebefc6d706e68c697e962b7e4467d00b47510ce0a8fdb8bae85781-Edit_Columns_icon.png" /> in the top right corner. The _Edit Columns_ popup opens.
2. Toggle ON to show the required column on the Engagements tab page.
3. Drag and drop the columns to reorder them.
4. Click **Apply Changes**.

## Sort Engagement Stats Rows

Click the column header. The ↑ icon indicates that the data is sorted in ascending order. The ↓ icon indicates that the data is sorted in descending order.

## Set Pagination for Engagement Stats

To choose how many items you view per page:

1. Use the **Items per page** drop-down at the bottom of the Engagement Stats page.
2. Select one of the following options: 10, 20, 30, or 40. By default, the page shows 20 stats.

## View Campaign Stats

The _Campaign Stats_ view reflects combined performance for the selected engagement node, even when multiple Campaign IDs are associated with it.

## Download CSV for Engagement Stats

You can export engagement data from the Engagements tab of a Journey as a CSV file. The downloaded file includes key metrics such as Engagement Node Name, Node ID, Campaign ID, Channel, Impressions, Clicks, and Engagement Rate. This is useful for audits, offline analysis, or sharing performance reports.

To download the engagement stats CSV:

1. Select the desired engagement nodes.
2. Click the <Image border={false} src="https://files.readme.io/dc353d489783c14e9f6fbb342fbbe86b1f4fa7da36ec311e770d3be748d4d8d9-download_icon_png.png" /> icon at the top of the table.

The CSV file downloads automatically. All the columns displayed on the screen are included in the CSV file.
