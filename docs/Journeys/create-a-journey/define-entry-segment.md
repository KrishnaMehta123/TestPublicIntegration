# Overview

The Entry Segment block can be considered as a starting point for creating a Journey. It defines the criteria based on which the users enter a Journey.

***

Remember that the selection made in the _Setup_ determines the segments available for drag and drop on the Journey canvas: 

| Configuration in Setup                         | Enabled Segments                                                                                                                 |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| If you selected _At a specific time_ in Setup  | The _Past behavior_, _Journey Trigger_, and _Custom list_ segments are enabled.                                                  |
| If you selected _By an event trigger_ in Setup | The _Action_, _Inaction_, _Date time_, _Journey Trigger_, _Page visit_, _Referrer entry_, and _Page count_ segments are enabled. |

***

To define the Entry Segment for a Journey: 

1. Drag and drop one of the desired segments to the **Entry Segment** block. For example, use the **Past behavior** segment. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/42fe360-Entry_Segment_Node_for_Journey.gif",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Entry Segment Node for Journeys"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Click the dropped **Entry Segment**. The **Segment** pane appears. The following image displays the **Who** section for a Past Behaviour segment. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/459e7b4-PBSSegment.jpg",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "50% ",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Enter the segment name. 
4. Under the **Who** section, also called Query Builder, define the criteria as required. All rules defined are combined using the **AND** operator. Users qualify only if they fulfill all the criteria. 
   - From the first list, select the [segment of users](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/define-entry-segment#find-users-from-the-segment).
   - From the second list, define the [user action criteria](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/define-entry-segment#filter-by-action). 
   - From the third list, define the [user inaction criteria](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/define-entry-segment#filter-by-inaction).
   - From the fourth list, define the [user properties criteria](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/define-entry-segment#filter-by-user-properties).
   - From the fifth list, define the [user interests criteria](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/define-entry-segment#filter-by-user-interest).
5. If required, select **Do not send users unsubscribed** to exclude the unsubscribed users from the Journey.
6. Click **Continue** and **Save & Close**.

# Entry Segment Criteria

Under the **Who** section, also called Query Builder, you can define the criteria for the user's entry into a Journey. 

## Find Users from the Segment

When you publish a Journey, users are filtered from the segment you select from this dropdown menu. Based on your Journey type, Past Behaviour, or Live Action, a list of existing segments appears. The below image shows the Past Behaviour Segments list. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9a70350-PastBehaaviourSegmentList.jpg",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "60% ",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Filter by Action

Using the **Who have done [Operator] of these events** filter in the **Who** section, you can filter users for your Journey based on their actions within a specified time. You may also filter the users depending on whether the event occurred for the first time, for the last time, at a given time of day, or on a specific day of the week. You can define one or more criteria to filter the users.

This set of criteria can be refined using the following two types of operators:

- **All (AND)**: Fetches users who match all the event criteria set in the action filter. For example, a user did _App Launched_ event and _Charged_ in the last 30 days. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ba54ec4-ANDOperator.jpg",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "60% ",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- **Any (OR)**: Fetches users who fulfill any combination of the event criteria set in the action filter. You can also specify how many times these events occur. For example, a user did _Video Watched_ event or _Video Liked_ event more than once in the last 30 days. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/827169a-OROperator.jpg",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "60% ",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Filter by Inaction

Using the **Who have not done** filter in the **Who** section, you can filter users for your Journey based on the actions they did not perform within a specified time. You may also filter the user depending on whether the event did not occur for the first time, for the last time, at a given time of day, or on a specific day of the week.

For instance, you can create a Journey that targets users as soon as they add a product to their cart but do not finish transacting within 10 minutes; that is the golden window within which most users transact on iOS and Android app platforms. By default, it evaluates all the criteria using the **OR** operator. If you specify multiple criteria, the user is qualified if any of the criteria are met.

## Filter by User Properties

Using the **With user properties** filter in the **Who** section, you can filter users for your Journey based on the user's properties such as language, location, gender, phone number, and so on. By default, it combines all the criteria using the **AND** operator.

For example, you can send a push notification to English-speaking female and male users who have a phone number.

The following table explains the various user property types:

  "data": {
    "h-0": "Property Type",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "h-2": "Example",
    "0-0": "**User Properties**",
    "0-1": "Custom [user profile properties](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles#section-user-profile-data-model) that you define and send to CleverTap.",

    "3-0": "**Geography Radius**",
    "3-1": "User's exact location. You can select a city and then define the target radius. You can also select multiple cities. You can receive this information using CleverTap's SDK.

    "5-1": "App fields filters include _App Version_, _Device Make_, _Device Model_, _OS Version_, and CleverTap _SDK Version_. CleverTap's SDK sends this information for each device with your app, meaning a single user can have multiple devices associated with the user profile.",

## Filter by User Interest

Using the **With interests** filter in the **Who** section, you can filter users for your Journey based on the user's interests, such as event property, time of the day, and specific day of the week. For more information, refer to the [Psychographic Segmentation](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/psychographic-segmentation) documentation. By default, it combines all the criteria using the **AND** operator.

The following table explains the various user interest types:

| Property Type        | Description                                                                            | Example                                        |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Property **  | Select the event property based on which you want to meet the criteria.                | For example, App Launched in the last 30 days. |
| **Time of the day ** | Time of day when the event was raised. It contains the start and end times.            | 12 PM - 6 PM                                   |
| **Day of the week**  | Day of the week when the event was raised, such as Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and so on. | Day of the week = Sunday                       |

After defining the entry segment criteria, you can choose how you want to communicate with the users. For more information about Journey paths, refer to the [Define Journey Path](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/construct-a-journey) section
