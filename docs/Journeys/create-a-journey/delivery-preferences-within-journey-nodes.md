# Overview

Node frequency provides the ability to define when the messages must be delivered. If a user qualifies outside this window, the message is discarded.

For example, you have qualified users based on their time with the platform and now want to introduce a new exciting feature and remind them of it every weekday in the next week. To do so, you can set node frequency to send the selected engagement type.

To set node frequency for In-App, Web pop-up, or Exit intent nodes in journeys: 

1. Select *In-app* and click on the node to edit it.
