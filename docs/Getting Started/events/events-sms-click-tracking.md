# Overview

Events track what individual actions users perform in your app or website. Some examples of events include a user launching an app, viewing a product, listening to a song, sharing a photo, making a purchase, or favoriting an item.

By tracking events in your app, you can better understand what users are doing. In CleverTap, you can analyze these events in many different ways, such as getting aggregating metrics of a specific event or measuring how a specific event type trends over time. You can also engage with your users based on these events by creating campaigns in CleverTap that are triggered by them.

## Event Categories

CleverTap has two categories of events:

- System events: Events recorded automatically after you integrate our SDK. 
- Custom events: Events you define and track with our SDK or API.

## Event Properties

Events have details that describe the action taking place called properties. 

For example, while recording the _Product viewed_ event, you could also store event properties, such as product name, category, and price. Recording event properties will help you discover insights, such as which category of products are more popular, and help you segment users based on which categories or price points they have viewed.

# System Events

System events are events recorded automatically after you integrate our SDK.

# Debug Events

Debug events are events recorded automatically after you integrate our SDK. These events are raised at certain lifecycle stages in your integration and help you track and manage your integration. These events are available on any profile page and _Find People_ page by adding a parameter to the end of the URL `?showDebugEvents=true`.

# Custom Events

Custom events are events you define and track with our SDK or API. For more information, refer to the [Events](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/events#custom-events) in the developer documentation.

# Event Data Types

CleverTap supports the following data types:

- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean
- Mixed

You can use an array only with the Charged event. All others will return an incorrect data type if using an array.

# Event Metadata Recorded Automatically

For every recorded event, CleverTap records the following standard metadata:

- Information about the user who performed the event.
- Date and time when the event was recorded.
- The number of screens viewed by the user before performing the action.
- The referring site and the source of the user visit if it was from an external source.

In addition, CleverTap keeps the user profiles updated with the latest:

- Geographic information like their city, region, country, and latitude/longitude (if available).
- Browser, device make, or model used to access the website or app.

# System Properties

CleverTap tracks the following system properties automatically from the mobile SDK. All the system properties are prefixed by _CT_ indicating that they are provided by CleverTap. 

The following properties are tracked automatically on all events:
