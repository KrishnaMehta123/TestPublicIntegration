## Overview

A Go Live Checklist lists tasks or items that must be completed or checked off before you make your application live for your users. It is a set of steps or actions that ensure everything is in order and ready for the final release or deployment.

A lot can go wrong when a feature goes live. Critical severity defects, security holes, and other technical problems can cause disruption and even result in a bad user experience. With careful planning, you can ensure a smooth and seamless user experience when going live with your application. It prevents last-minute issues and eliminates repetitive human errors.

The following are two types of checklists to ensure the readiness of your application before you make it live to your users:
