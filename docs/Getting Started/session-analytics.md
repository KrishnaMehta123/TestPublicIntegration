# Overview

*Session Analytics* can be used to track the events that users perform within a session. Analyzing session length is a great way to measure engagement for certain apps, such as video or music streaming, news, and so on.

A session is a period of continuous activity by the user. A user can perform as many events as required over a period of time; however, we consider a session timeout after 20 minutes of user inactivity. A new session is created after this session timeout. Sessions can be tracked on the Web as well as mobile apps. 

> 📘 Tracking Sessions
>
> Sessions cannot be tracked for events pushed through API calls.

# Activate Sessions

You can start tracking user sessions after activating sessions from the CleverTap dashboard. The ability to track sessions is available in *Settings* > *Session Analytics*.

After you activate session tracking, you have the following:

* The *Session Concluded* event is raised to mark the end of every session.
* A new system property called *CT Session ID* is available for every custom event.
* A *Session Board* is available within the *Boards* section.

> 🚧 List of Events that Are Not Considered
>
> The following events are not considered for a session:
>
> * App Installed
> * App Uninstalled
> * UTM Visited
> * Identity Set
> * Identity Reset
> * Identity Error
> * Push Impressions
> * Notification Sent
> * *Notification Clicked*: These events are not considered for engagement channels like Email, Web Push, or Mobile Push.\
>   However, they are considered for channels such as Native Display, App Inbox, In-App, Web Exit Intent, and Web Popup.
> * *Notification Viewed*: These events are not considered for engagement channels like Email or Web Push.\
>   However, they are considered for channels such as Native Display, App Inbox, In-App, Web Exit Intent, and Web Popup.

# CT Session ID

A system property called *CT Session ID* is available for each custom event. This *CT Session ID* also appears on the user’s profile page.

# Session Concluded Event

A system event called *Session Concluded* marks the end of a session. This event is raised after 20 minutes of inactivity.

The *Session Concluded* event contains the following event properties:

* Session Length: It is the time period from the first event up to the last event measured in seconds. 
* Session ID: It is a unique ID to identify the session. 

> 🚧 Availability Note
>
> This event is not available for engagement in the live user segments.

> 📘 Timestamp for a Session Concluded
>
> The timestamp for the *Session Concluded* event is the same as the most recent event.
>
> For example, *Event 1* was performed at 11:00 AM and *Event 2* was performed at 11:10 AM. There is a period of inactivity after this event. After waiting for 20 minutes, a *Session Concluded* event is raised at 11.30 AM, however, the timestamp for the *Session Concluded* event is marked as 11:10 AM to identify the exact time of the last activity.

# Session Dashboard

This board is created automatically after you turn on session tracking. To view the session dashboard, perform the following:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, click **Boards**. 
2. Check for a board called *Session* and open it.

The session dashboard displays an overview of the app sessions with the following information:

* Session length distribution: The distribution of session length (in seconds).
* Sum of session lengths per day: The total session length across all users per day in the last 30 days.
* Number of sessions: The number of sessions in a day that occurred over the past 30 days.
