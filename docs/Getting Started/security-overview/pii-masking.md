# Overview

Masking hides sensitive information from unauthorized users, such as emails, phone numbers, or payment IDs. This feature ensures that PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is visible only to users with the appropriate [role-based access](doc:role-based-access-control). It helps businesses comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and enforce internal data governance policies.

# Mask Event Data

CleverTap masks specific system user properties and allows users to mask custom user and event properties of their preference.

## System Properties

CleverTap pre-masks specific System User and Event properties.

The following lists all the system user and event properties masked by default.

**System User Properties**

* Email
* Phone number
* Identity
* Name
* Gender
* DOB (Date of Birth)
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Location

**System Event Properties**

* Email
* Phone number
* Identity
* For the event **Identity Set**, the PII property `ID` is masked.
* For the event **Identity Reset**, the PII property `ID` is masked.
* For the event **Identity Error**, the PII property `ID` is masked.

For more information on System Events and properties, refer to [Events](doc:events#overview).

## Custom Properties

CleverTap supports two ways to mask custom event properties:

* Mask a Single Property
* Mask Multiple Properties in Bulk

### Mask a Single Property

Users can mask a single user or event property, such as a user name or email.

To mask a single custom event property, perform the following steps:

1. Go to _Settings_ > _Schema_ >_Events_ > _Custom events_.
2. Click the _Properties_ hyperlink for the relevant custom event.
3. Click the ![](https://files.readme.io/fb90f6a-Ellipsis.png) icon, next to the property name and select **Mask**.
4. In the confirmation dialog, click **Mask**.

This action masks the value of selected properties.

Once confirmed, CleverTap masks the selected property in the background. The Admin user receives an email notification after masking a property.

### Mask Bulk Properties

Users can simultaneously mask multiple properties of a single custom event for faster setup. To mask multiple custom event properties in bulk, perform the following steps:

1. Go to _Settings_ > _Schema_ > _Events_ > _Custom events_.
2. Click the _Properties_ hyperlink for the relevant custom event.
3. Select the properties to mask, then click the ![](https://files.readme.io/f5d0869de355db2c753f2c712fb174e07e0c4ca7c98e40ffb130035cefae64a8-2025-05-08_03-05-09.png) mask icon to mask properties in bulk.
4. In the confirmation dialog, click **Mask**.

<Image align="center" alt="Mask Properties in Bulk" border={true} caption="Mask Custom Properties in Bulk" src="https://files.readme.io/9dcacf8fcbf672a377ed27003032bb9baafb53898792e39d3d1809d4f8673af7-2025-05-08_02-17-57_1.gif" />

This action masks the values of all selected properties. Only admins can mask/unmask an event property.

<Image align="center" alt="Masked property queued for processing" border={true} caption="Masked Property Queued for Processing" src="https://files.readme.io/ebad65c9d791a15ae65099da746df83b2e9071c7bb4caa370da64d75d9a71974-image.png" />

Once the properties are masked, they are queued for processing. Within a few minutes, values for all masked properties are replaced with placeholder text as shown below:

  **Download Restriction on PII Values**

  CSV downloads follow encrypted PII access permissions. Admins and users with encrypted PII access via custom roles can view the actual values.

  For users without encrypted PII access, certain fields are restricted during export, as follows:

  * **System user properties:** Encrypted fields are unavailable for selection in the CSV download confirmation pop-up.
  * **Custom user properties:** Encrypted columns are included in the CSV, but the values appear as blank.
</Callout>

# Unmask Event Data

To Unmask a single custom event property, perform the following:

1. Go to _Settings_ > _Schema_ >_Events_ > _Custom events_.
2. Click the _Properties_ hyperlink for the relevant custom event.
3. Click the ![](https://files.readme.io/fb90f6a-Ellipsis.png) icon, next to the property name and select **Unmask**.
4. In the confirmation dialog, click **Unmask**.

<Image align="center" alt="Unmask Single Custom Property" border={true} caption="Unmask Single Custom Property" src="https://files.readme.io/558beee8be7de5adc325a9b16e54811a7280dfd1d3862505f02e287f9bcc1a91-2025-05-28_23-18-54_1.gif" />

# Masked Data

* Masked values appear as obfuscated or placeholder text in the dashboard.
* Users with restricted access are unable to view the actual property value. For example, a masked value of an email appears as below:

<Image align="center" border={true} width="90% " src="https://files.readme.io/258b637bcc866a1fdfcbc779b7b9247a923632ee399f399b0088b9b44b870f9f-image.png" className="border" />

* Admin users can view PII values in plain text or unmask them as needed, while other user roles with PII visibility access can only view the masked icon.
