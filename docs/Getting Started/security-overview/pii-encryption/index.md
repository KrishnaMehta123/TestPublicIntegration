# Overview

Encryption secures Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by converting it into unreadable formats that only authorized users can decrypt with valid keys. PII includes sensitive data such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, custom properties, and events. By encrypting this information, CleverTap ensures data remains protected from unauthorized access throughout its lifecycle.

The encryption framework uses secure algorithms to protect data while maintaining usability for segmentation, analytics, and campaign delivery.

Encryption helps you do the following:

* Prevent unauthorized access to PII
* Transmit customer data securely across systems
* Comply with global and local data protection regulations
* Create a detailed audit trail to meet global compliance standards

> This feature is currently available in Private Beta for selected customers. To enable PII Encryption, contact your Customer Success Manager or raise a support ticket.

# Encrypt PII

CleverTap encrypts PII using multiple layers of protection, making sensitive values unreadable at different stages:

* **In Transit**: Encrypts data transmitted via SDKs and SFTP.
* **At Rest**: Encrypts stored data in databases, backups, and persistent storage.

This layered protection ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance without compromising usability.

## Default vs. Custom Encryption

By default, CleverTap encrypts all incoming user data using AES-256 encryption and securely manages the encryption keys. This default protection applies to all user profiles and event attributes.

Custom Encryption provides an additional layer of protection over the default encryption. It allows customers to mark selected fields (such as email, phone, customerType, and so on) for encryption. CleverTap applies AES-256 encryption using customer-defined keys. It protects sensitive data without impacting performance.

## Security and Compliance

PII Encryption helps your organization to do the following:

* Protect customer data against unauthorized access
* Ensure secure storage and transmission of data
* Meet compliance standards such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and ISO 27001
* Enforce role-based access and audit controls

## Eligible Data

You can mark any of the following system properties for encryption:

**System User Properties**

* Email
* Phone number
* Identity
* Name
* Gender
* DOB (Date of Birth)
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Location

**System Event Properties**

* Email
* Phone number
* Identity
* For the event **Identity Set**, the PII property `ID` is masked.
* For the event **Identity Reset**, the PII property `ID` is masked.
* For the event **Identity Error**, the PII property `ID` is masked.

For more information about system events and properties, refer to [Events](doc:events#overview).

You can also enable encryption for custom events. Once you allow encryption for a custom event property, CleverTap encrypts new incoming data. CleverTap does not encrypt historical data.

> 🚧 Encryption is an irreversible process.
>
> You cannot revert a property to an unencrypted state.

## Encrypt Data at Rest

CleverTap automatically encrypts stored data using industry-standard encryption methods:

* Uses AES-256 encryption for all stored data
* Manages encryption keys through key management
* Implements key rotation and audit logging based on industry-accepted best practices

## Encrypt Data in Transit

CleverTap secures all data transferred via SDKs ([Android](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/android-advanced-features#encryption-in-transit) & [iOS](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/advanced-options-ios#encryption-of-pii-data)) and [SFTP](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/file-upload-encryption):

* Uses TLS 1.3 for transport security
* Uses AES-256 (SDK) and PGP encryption (SFTP)
* Supports mutual TLS (mTLS) for SDK communications
* Routes requests to region-specific endpoints for compliance with data residency regulations
