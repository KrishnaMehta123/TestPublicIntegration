# Overview

Events track what individual actions users perform in your app or website. Some examples of events include a user launching an app, viewing a product, listening to a song, sharing a photo, making a purchase, or favoriting an item.

By tracking events in your app, you can better understand what users are doing. In CleverTap, you can analyze these events in many different ways, such as getting aggregating metrics of a specific event or measuring how a specific event type trends over time. You can also engage with your users based on these events by creating campaigns in CleverTap that are triggered by them.

## Event Categories

CleverTap has two categories of events:

* System events: Events recorded automatically after you integrate our SDK.
* Custom events: Events you define and track with our SDK or API.

## Event Properties

Events have details that describe the action taking place called properties.

For example, while recording the _Product viewed_ event, you could also store event properties, such as product name, category, and price. Recording event properties will help you discover insights, such as which product category is more popular, and segment users based on which categories or price points they have viewed.

System events are events recorded automatically after you integrate our SDK.

The first case is when a user installs your app, uninstalls it, and then reinstalls it. The second case is when a user clears your app's memory and relaunches it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

In most cases, this indicates successful delivery to the end user. For campaigns sent via Generic SMTP, CleverTap should receive a [callback](doc:generic-smtp-v2-payload) to raise this event.<br /><br />**Note**: [Notification Delivered](doc:email-campaign-stats-delivered) is currently released in Private Beta for Infobip (in the case of Advanced Email add-on) and Sendgrid email providers. Contact your Customer Success Manager for access.<br /><br />In the case of SMS campaigns, it is raised when the notification is delivered to the end user, and CleverTap receives the [callback](doc:generic-sms#sms-callbacks). It includes the `Provider` event property, a string value that represents the service through which the campaign is sent. For example, Twilio.<br /><br />In the case of WhatsApp, it is raised when the provider confirms that the notification has reached the end user (double-tick of WhatsApp).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# Debug Events

Debug events are events recorded automatically after you integrate our SDK. These events are raised at certain lifecycle stages in your integration and help you track and manage your integration. These events are available on any profile page and _Find People_ page by adding a parameter to the end of the URL `?showDebugEvents=true`.

# Custom Events

Custom events are events you define and track with our SDK or API. For more information, refer to the [Events](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/events#custom-events) in the developer documentation.

## Charged Event

CleverTap also records transactions or purchases using a special event called **Charged**. Clevertap enriches this special event with additional information such as items sold, their categories, transaction amount, transaction ID, and information about your users. Recording a purchase against a user marks them as a customer in CleverTap and enables you to compare your funnel reports between customers and other users.

When recording customer purchases, you can also record the following:

* Items Sold
  You must use the Items collection to record a list of items sold. Along with the product name, you can add properties such as size, color, category, etc.

* Transaction Amount
  The transaction total or subscription charge must be recorded in an event property called Amount.

For more information about recording a Charged event, refer to [Events](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/events#recording-customer-purchases) under developer documentation.

### Advantages of the Charged Event

The following are the advantages of Charged event:

* Helps you identify your customers and how they are using your app or website
* Run campaigns to reward loyal users or get lost customers back
* Measure customer loyalty via running a cohort analysis on repeat purchases
* Analyze paid campaign performance by total revenue earned
* Get revenue insights like – total revenue, number of transactions, count of paying users, and much more

### Charged Event Personalization

You can personalize the message for customers who purchase multiple items in a single transaction. You can do so by using liquid tags from the CleverTap dashboard, as shown in the following sample codes:

* **Using for Loops in Liquid Tags**

* **Using Manual Indexing in Liquid Tags**

`Event.items` is a custom array property that you can use to store additional information about items associated with an event. It allows you to include item-specific details when tracking events. For example, if an event called "Charged" represents a user making a purchase, you can use the `Charged.Items` array to store information about the specific items purchased within that event. Each item in the array can have its own properties, such as name, price, quantity, and so.

You can personalize the message for any number of items in the `Event.items` array. For example, you want to send an email including order details to the customers who bought three books from your e-commerce website. The `Event.items` array, in this case, would include three items, and you can send a personalized message for all three items.

![](https://files.readme.io/aef5e4b-Charged_Event_Personalization.png) Charged Event Personalization

In the case of manual indexing, you can ensure that the index is smaller than the size of the Items array using `Event.Items.size`. If the index value exceeds the size of the Items array, the message is NOT dispatched and is marked against errors.

> 📘 Charged Event Personalization for App Inbox Campaigns
>
> * In the case of App Inbox campaigns, event personalization for `Charged.Items` is not enabled.
> * However, if you use event personalization with `Charged.Items`, the default values for the items are displayed in the case of App Inbox campaigns.
