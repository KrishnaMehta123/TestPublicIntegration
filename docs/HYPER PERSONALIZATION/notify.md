# Use Cases

Notify is ideal for delivering critical transactional messages across multiple touchpoints. The following use cases show how Notify enables real-time communication to enhance user experience, strengthen security, and ensure operational clarity:

* **OTP Delivery for Login/Authentication**  
  Send time-sensitive OTPs to users to verify identity or enable secure login. For example, a user tries logging into a banking app and receives a 6-digit OTP on their registered email.
* **Order Confirmation and Receipts**  
  Confirm purchases or bookings immediately by sending transactional messages with order summaries.  
  For example:
  * After placing an order on an online grocery app, the user receives an email confirming the order with itemized billing details.
  * A travel booking site sends an order summary via email after successful payment.
* **Payment Success and Failure Notifications**  
  Inform users in real time about the status of their transactions to prevent confusion and avoid duplicate payments. For example:
  * A credit card user receives an email notification confirming the successful payment.
  * In case of a failed transaction, the user receives an email stating that the payment was unsuccessful and providing guidance on the next steps or retrying.
* **Account and Password Reset Links**  
  Send secure password reset or account recovery links to users requesting access recovery. For example:
  * When users click **Forgot Password** on a social media platform, they immediately receive an email with a password reset link that expires in 10 minutes.
  * Users trying to change their email addresses are sent a verification link to the new email for confirmation.
* **Security Notifications**  
  Alert users instantly about critical changes to their account to detect and prevent unauthorized access. For example, when a user logs in from a new device, the system sends an email to notify the user.

# Create Notify Campaign

Trigger transactional messages in real time based on specific user actions. For example, when a user completes a bill payment, you can trigger a confirmation email using the _Payment Success_ event.

To create a Notify campaign, perform the following steps:

1. Go to _Notify_  from the CleverTap dashboard and click **Create Notify Campaign**. The _Setup_ popup opens.

<Image align="center" alt="Create Notify Campaign" border={true} caption="Create Notify Campaign" src="https://files.readme.io/5a157b0ef34c4ab306de7ee2991dc9f10983a49cc2f8746ee8dd928d809e11f8-2025-07-16_11-54-42_1.gif" />

2. Enter the campaign **Name** and click **Continue**. The _Channel Setup_ page opens.

3. Select the provider from the dropdown under _Provider Configuration_. You can also add a new service provider by clicking **Add Provider**. For more information, refer to [Email Provider Setup](doc:email_providers_operations).

4. Click **Create Message** under _Content_ to create your campaign message as follows:
   1. Select an email template or create your own template for your Notify message.
   2. Draft a message and enter the _Sender Details_. For more information, refer to [Email Editor](doc:create-message-email). You can personalize messages in two ways:
      * **User Property Personalization**: Uses profile properties for personalization, for example, `{{Profile.name | default:"Shopper"}}`.
      * **Notify API Parameter Personalization**: Uses a key from the `notifyFields` object in the API payload, for example, `{{Notify.orderID | default:"Order number not available"}}`.  
        When the campaign is triggered via API, CleverTap pulls the value from the object in your payload and injects it into the message. This enables you to personalize email order details based on real-time values. For more information, refer to [Notify API](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/notify-api).

<Image align="center" alt="Personalization Keys for Notify" border={true} caption="Personalization Keys for Notify" src="https://files.readme.io/d2a6a0502bef5fe08749d2cbf79e61a4d55a86e27adba01a8fe0ded77cf132b1-Personalized_Notify_Campaign.png" />

> 📘 Anonymous Profile
>
> When the recipient profile does not exist on the dashboard, the message is still sent. But delivery or engagement metrics are not tracked for such profiles.

5. Click **Done** to return to the _Channel Setup_ screen. You can choose to edit your Notify message or review the content layout using Preview before generating the Notify ID without sending a test message.
6. Click **Preview & Test** to check how your message renders and appears in the recipient's inbox. You can use this option to send a test message to an internal recipient for validation. Test messages display the default values defined during campaign creation.
7. After creating an Email campaign, Click **Generate** to create the transaction ID or script required to trigger your Notify campaign. Once generated, copy the ID/script and use it in the [Notify API](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/notify-api) request to launch the campaign.

<Image align="center" alt="Generate " border={true} caption="Generate Notify ID" src="https://files.readme.io/12a2419d5f1c686d3fae52451ee37403f7f28cec60b98fc42aea6ac37e206b35-image.png" width="40% " />

> 📘 No Frequency Cap or DND Limits
>
> Notify messages are exempt from global frequency caps and DND settings, ensuring timely delivery of critical transactional messages.
