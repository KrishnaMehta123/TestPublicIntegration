#Select an Event
This is the event in which CleverTap will consider similar items. Follow the steps below:

1. Select an event from which to generate recommendations. You can access the events that have been mapped to the chosen catalog. 
2. Select the relevant timeframe for which you want to generate the recommendations (e.g., create recommendations for items that have been viewed together in the last 10 days).

##Some Examples
Below are some examples:

###e-Commerce App
An e-Commerce app may want to trigger a recommendation as soon as a user adds Nike shoes to cart. 
* In this scenario, you can recommend other shoes to the user. 
* This can be either based on the shoes that the user may have viewed together or searched together in the last 30 days.
* In this case, the event to select would be *Viewed* together or *Searched* together.

###Video Streaming App
A video streaming app may want to trigger a recommendation once a user completes watching a trailer of a fantasy TV series. 
 * In this scenario, you can recommend other shows that have been watched together with fantasy TV shows in the last 10 days. 
 * In this case, the event to select would be *Watched* together.

#Filter Recommendations
