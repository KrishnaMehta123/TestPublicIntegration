# Overview

Bulletins are a category of engagement campaigns that are not broadly capitalized in the mobile engagement space. Instead of an organization creating hundreds of campaigns a day for various SKUs, the process is automated in the CleverTap platform. Users can set up campaigns and dispatch bulletins for a business event with any number of properties. 

Bulletins provide the ability to send automated, scalable campaigns based on events that happen on the business side to users who are likely to be interested. When a user performs an event or does not perform an event in a certain amount of time, a message can be sent prompting action.

## User Scenarios

The following are examples of bulletin use cases:

### Example #1

A movie streaming app has a new notification for users who watch a particular movie genre on a regular basis. As an app subscriber, the customer receives a push notification regarding the new season that was just released. The business event _episode_release_ is sent to the CleverTap system via an API. A published bulletin for the business event is dispatched when the business event occurs.

### Example #2

A company creates 200 daily campaigns for their television shows. Each campaign is slightly different, and the customer does not want to come to the dashboard to spend around five minutes for every similar campaign they create. By using bulletins, they can automate the process to communicate with the interest groups with a personalized message.

### Example #3

A music streaming app sends a new notification for users as soon as a new album for an artist is released. As an app subscriber, the customer receives a push notification regarding the new album that was just released if the customer has heard, downloaded, or favorited 10 or more songs from the artist recently. The business event _album_release_ is sent to the CleverTap system via an API. A published bulletin for the business event is dispatched when the business event occurs.

## Create Business Events

Before a bulletin can be published, define a business event which is the event performed by the business (e.g., episode releases, book launch, or weekly sales). The following instructions illustrate a business event named _episode_release_ which represents a new episode being released. 

1. Select the _Bulletins_ option on the left navigation menu.
2. Click **+ Business Event**.

3. Enter the following information:

- Business event name: This is the event performed by your business (e.g., episode releases, weekly sales).
- Business event properties: These are the other identifiers related to a business event (e.g., movie title, genre, series, language).
- Goal (optional): This is the desired outcome of the Bulletin (e.g., app launched, movie watched, series watched).
- Value of user event property: This is the value of the user event property that should match the business event property (i.e., as a user I watched Show A and Show A is the business event property of the show being released).

## Monitor Bulletin Performance

CleverTap provides comprehensive monitoring for the performance of bulletins. The _Percentage of Users Converted_ graph displays the percentage of qualified users who were sent a bulletin. It also displays the users who viewed or clicked the bulletin. The graph shows the total number of technical and non-technical delivery errors.
