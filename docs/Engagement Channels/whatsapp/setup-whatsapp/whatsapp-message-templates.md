- **Easy Opt-out Steps:** Clearly state how end-users can opt out of WhatsApp notifications, ensuring a smooth and respectful opt-out process.
- **Avoid Promoting Forbidden Business Verticals:** Steer clear of promoting forbidden business verticals to prevent template rejection and potential account bans.
- **Formatting Rules:** Adhere to guidelines on naming, size, and text formatting for template compliance and approval.

# WhatsApp Template Categories

> 📘 Template Category Selection
> 
> CleverTap BSP (Whatsapp Direct) users can select categories during template creation for Meta review, ensuring content alignment. This feature is specific to CleverTap BSP.  
> However, for external providers, template creation occurs in their WhatsApp provider's dashboards. Hence, template category selection is not available during template configuration in the CleverTap dashboard for external providers.

WhatsApp templates are divided into various categories, each serving specific communication needs. Understanding these categories and their ideal use cases is crucial for effective messaging.

## Marketing Categories

 WhatsApp provides the most flexible marketing templates. These templates enable businesses to achieve various goals, from generating awareness to driving sales. 

- **Awareness:** Introduce new products or services.
- **Sales:**Promote general offers, coupons, or sales events.
- **Retargeting:** Re-engage customers who visit your website or app.

## Utility Categories

Utility templates are triggered by a user action or request. They must include details about the active or ongoing transaction, account, subscription, or interaction to which they relate. For example, an order confirmation must contain an order number.

- **Opt-In Management on WhatsApp:** Confirm opt-in or opt-out preferences.
- **Order Management:** Confirm, update, or cancel orders with specific details.
- **Account Alerts or Updates:** Send important account updates and alerts.
- **Feedback Surveys :**Collect feedback on orders or interactions.

     - The _Template type_ (for example, Basic, Limited-Time Offer, or Carousel) cannot be changed for the cloned template. To use a different template type, create a new template instead of cloning.

> 
> 1. Identify the specific campaign or journey that is encountering the error.
> 2. Access the _What_ section of the campaign or the specific journey node.
> 3. Edit the campaign or journey and select the specific imported templates.
> 4. Save and publish the changes, and check that the campaigns and journeys use the updated templates.

> 📘 Track Button Clicks
> 
> Check the URL defined to track the button clicks in the META dashboard. For example, _ct1.io.//{{1}}_. This URL will be imported with the template in the CleverTap dashboard. This link cannot be updated later.
