# Campaign Stats in WhatsApp

Campaign stats for the WhatsApp channel in CleverTap provide valuable insights into the performance of your engagement campaigns. When you create a WhatsApp engagement campaign on the CleverTap dashboard, messaging API requests are generated by CleverTap for each qualified user based on the campaign setup. These messaging requests are then sent to your WhatsApp providers, following the agreed API contracts. CleverTap marks the messages as *Sent* if the requests are successfully accepted by the provider.

Once the messaging API requests are submitted to the providers, they forward them to WhatsApp, which handles the delivery of the messages to the end users.

> 📘 Delivery to end user
>
> The delivery process to the end users is managed by the WhatsApp service provider, and CleverTap does not have any control over this.

WhatsApp sends **Delivered**, **Failed**, **Read**, and **Replies** events to the providers when notifications are delivered and read by the end users. The providers, in turn, forward these DLR events to CleverTap through callback URLs, following the agreed callback formats. CleverTap receives these callbacks and registers the DLR events as **notification delivered**, **notification viewed**, **notification replied**, and uses these events to populate the campaign stats.

However, it's important to note that callback issues can lead to discrepancies in the campaign stats. If the callback URLs are misconfigured or experiencing technical problems, CleverTap may not receive the DLR events, resulting in fewer Delivered, Viewed, or Replied events being recorded than expected. It's important to ensure that the callback URLs are set up and functioning correctly.

# WhatsApp Event Stats

To view the statistics of your campaign, select the campaign from the campaign list page.

You can track the overall performance of your WhatsApp messages using the following metrics:

### Sent

Represents the number of messages dispatched successfully from a campaign. 

WhatsApp Notifications are marked as **Sent** in CleverTap only if the notification/message API request is accepted by the customer's WhatsApp provider; else, the notifications are considered dispatch errors. The *Sent* event count in campaign stats explains the number of notifications successfully sent to WhatsApp providers.  

> 📘 Notification Success
>
> The successful dispatch of a notification does not guarantee its delivery to the end users. Notifications can fail to reach the intended recipients due to various reasons, such as invalid templates, incorrect phone numbers, and other potential issues that may occur at the provider's or WhatsApp's end.

### Delivered

These are the number of messages delivered to the user's device from a campaign. The provider informs CleverTap when a message is delivered via callback URLs. After receiving these delivered callbacks, CleverTap marks these messages as **Delivered**.

CleverTap then displays the delivered count on the campaign stats. The message status callbacks must be configured correctly with your provider to transmit this information. 

The following causes can impact the delivered stats:

* Message status callback is not configured correctly.
* Incorrect format for the callback from the provider.

### Viewed

These are the number of messages viewed from the user's device. WhatsApp's blue tick indicates that the message has been viewed. The provider informs CleverTap when a message is viewed via callback URLs, and then CleverTap marks these messages as **Viewed**. CleverTap displays the Viewed count on the basis of viewed callbacks in the campaign stats. 

The following causes can impact the viewed stats:

* Message status callback is not configured correctly.
* Incorrect format for the callback from the provider.
* The user has turned off read receipts.

### Replied

This represents the number of replies received after sending a campaign. The incoming response from a user is attributed to the last WhatsApp notification sent by CleverTap to that particular user.

When an end user replies to a business, WhatsApp forwards the incoming message to the provider, and the provider, in turn, forwards the message to CleverTap via the incoming message callback URL. These incoming messages are captured as **Notification replied event** at CleverTap and attributed to the last campaign sent to a user from the CleverTap dashboard. The total number of replies received after the campaign is shown as **Replied stats** in the campaign.

The following causes can impact the replied stats:

* The user has not received any previous WhatsApp campaigns from the CleverTap dashboard.
* Message status callback is not configured correctly.
* Incorrect format for the callback from the provider.

### Converted Users

It represents the number of users who performed the conversion goal after receiving the WhatsApp campaign from CleverTap. 

### Control Group

These are the users who were excluded from the WhatsApp campaign to test the influence of the campaign. For more information, see [Control Groups](doc:control-groups)

## Message Trend

Shows the daily, weekly, and monthly trends for WhatsApp campaign messages.

## Conversion Performance

It shows the comparison of the conversion rates between users in the Control group (users who were excluded from the campaign) and the Target group (users who received the campaign). This enables you to evaluate the efficacy of your overall campaign performance.

### Revenue Performance

Shows the boost in revenue and the incremental revenue from the campaign.

### Users Conversion Funnel

The user conversion funnel for a WhatsApp campaign in CleverTap is a series of stages that users progress through, from campaign delivery to the desired action. It tracks the message Sent, Delivered, Viewed, and Converted stages to show the conversion performance and help marketers further optimize the campaign.

You can clear the Delivered and Viewed events from the conversion performance bars to see the focus on the conversion result of your campaign. 

## Campaign Stat Errors

CleverTap classifies campaign errors in two categories:

* Dispatch errors
* Delivery errors

<Image alt="Error Types" align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/8188caa-small-whatsapp_campaign_errors.png">
  Error Types
</Image>

> 🚧 Notification Clicked Not Supported
>
> In the case of WhatsApp, CleverTap receives data points (such as Sent, Delivered, Viewed.) from Whatsapp as callbacks. However, WhatsApp does not support callbacks for Clicks. Therefore, the Notification Clicked event cannot be tracked and viewed under the *Overall Stats* tab.

### Dispatch errors

Dispatch errors occur when there are failures or issues during the process of dispatching messages from CleverTap to the provider. These errors can include situations like request timeouts or API authentication failures.\
Dispatch errors clarify the discrepancy between the number of qualified user count and the sent count.

> 📘 Campaign Limits
>
> Incase you apply campaign limits in campaign setup, dispatch errors will clarify the discrepancy between applied campaign limit and the sent count.

### Delivery errors

These errors are raised when a notification is sent successfully from CleverTap but does not reach the intended recipient. These failures usually take place at the provider's end or at WhatsApp's end, and these failures are passed to CleverTap via DLR callback URL. These errors represent the difference between the Sent and Delivered message count.

For example, a notification is not delivered by the provider for some technical issue. In this case, the provider will notify CleverTap, and then we will display it as a delivery error.
