You must integrate Google Ads, and CleverTap accounts to segment users in CleverTap and automatically upload those users to the Google Ads account. The integration enables you to easily run remarketing campaigns where you show ads to specific segments of your users across Google Search Network, YouTube, and Gmail.

## Connect Google Ads Account

Connect the Google Ads account to your CleverTap account. The \_Google ads account ID \_is available at the top right on your Google Dashboard. For more information about finding your Ads Customer ID, refer to [Google Support](https://support.google.com/ads/express/answer/6083253).

The process involves adding Google Ads Customer ID to the CleverTap dashboard. To do so: 

1. Log in to the [CleverTap Dashboard](https://dashboard.clevertap.com/). 
2. Navigate to _Settings_ > _Channels_ > _Remarketing_.
3. Enter the _Google ads account ID_, and then click **Connect**.
4. (Optional) Enter your Manager account ID for a linked [Manager Account](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/tools/manager-accounts/).
