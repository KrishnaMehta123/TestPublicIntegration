# FAQs

### While uploading the Google Audience list from Clevertap, we received an error “Advertiser not Whitelisted.”

To ‘Whitelist’ your Google Ads account, you need to directly contact your Google Ads support team as CleverTap has no access to this. In the meantime, you can refer to the [blog by Google Ad](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717), which mentions criteria to be met before you use ‘Customer Match’ as an upload option for remarketing.
