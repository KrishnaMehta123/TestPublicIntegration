# Overview

Connect and manage Facebook Ads accounts within CleverTap for remarketing. Once integrated, you can sync segments, configure default accounts, and take administrative actions such as reconnecting or removing accounts.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting a Facebook Ads account, check that the following requirements are met:

* **Facebook Business Manager Account**\
  Recommended for centralized management of assets such as WhatsApp Business Manager, Ads Manager, and Product Catalogs.

* **Active Ads Account**\
  The Facebook Ads account must be active and connected to the Business Manager Account.

* **Admin Access**\
  The connecting user must have administrative permission to access the ad account.

* **Custom Audiences Terms Acceptance**\
  The administrator must have accepted Facebook’s Custom Audiences [Terms of Service](https://business.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos) . If the default link does not load, append your Facebook Ad Account ID to the end of the URL as shown below:

```html
<https://business.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos/?act=>\<your_ad_account_id>
```

## View and Manage Connected Ad Accounts

This section displays all Facebook Ads accounts that have been linked to your CleverTap project. You can view key account details, check connection status, and perform actions such as setting a default account or removing an existing one.

To access this section, go to *Settings > Channels > Remarketing > Facebook*.

* **Account Name**: The display name of the connected Facebook Ads account.
* **Status**: Indicates whether the account is currently *Connected* or *Disconnected*.

## Reconnecting an Account

Authentication tokens expire periodically for security reasons. When this happens, the account’s **Status** will display as *Disconnected*.

To restore the connection, click ![](https://files.readme.io/270abb959e6febec395aefee567f56e73f74aac0f129a5705c276f3db3f513d3-image_60.png) and repeat the authorization flow to re-establish access. This ensures continued security while maintaining seamless integration.
