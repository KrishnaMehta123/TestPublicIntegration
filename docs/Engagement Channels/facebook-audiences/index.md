Facebook Audiences are a great way to re-engage with users outside of your app or website, via ads on Facebook. The *Facebook Audiences* module on the CleverTap dashboard (under *Campaigns*) makes it easy to set up Facebook Audiences advertisements for all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created on the basis of past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties.
