# Overview

Web popup messages are notifications that are displayed on desktop or mobile websites when a user is actively surfing a web page. CleverTap's Web Popup channel allows you to send quick alerts, offers, or how-to byte-sized content to your customers using CleverTap's built-in web popup builder or your own custom HTML templates.

CleverTap offers two types of web pop-ups:

- **Simple web pop-up notifications**: You can use these templates to create your notifications including a box notification, a banner notification, and an interstitial notification.
- **Exit intent notifications**: These notifications are displayed just as the user is about to exit your site by closing the browser window or tab. These are only available for desktop browsers. Read about [web exit-intent pop-ups](doc:web-exit-intent-overview) to learn more.

> 🚧 Prerequisite
> 
> The prerequisite to set up web popup campaigns is to integrate your website with the CleverTap Web SDK. For more information, refer to [Web](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/web) in the developer documentation.

The _Web Popup_ feature makes it easy to set up web popup campaigns for all your users or specific user segments.
