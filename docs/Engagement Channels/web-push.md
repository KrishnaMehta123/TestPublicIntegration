# Overview

Web push notifications (also known as Browser Push Notifications) are browser-based messages you can send to your website users. End-users receive these notifications even if they are not active on your website.

Web push notifications provide the ability to communicate brief, yet important alerts to your users while CleverTap’s rich segmentation and powerful infrastructure can help send time-sensitive, relevant, and personalized push messages at scale.

> 🚧 Prerequisite
> 
> The prerequisite to setting up web push campaigns requires a specific code configuration. For more information, refer to the [Web SDK Integration page](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/web) in the developer documentation.

The _Web Push_ feature makes it easy to set up web push campaigns for all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created on the basis of past/live user behavior, user properties, or a combination of user behavior and properties.
