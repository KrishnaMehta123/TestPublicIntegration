# Overview

RCS (Rich Communication Services) is the next generation of mobile messaging that enables rich, interactive, and branded conversations within a user’s default messaging app. Unlike traditional SMS, RCS supports advanced features like image and video sharing, carousels, quick replies, and actionable buttons—all delivered in a secure, native interface.

CleverTap allows you to leverage RCS as a powerful engagement channel to deliver personalized, real-time communication to your users. You can also use RCS to automate journeys and integrate fallback to SMS for seamless message delivery.

## RCS as a Channel

RCS messages offer a native, app-free messaging experience for end-users & businesses and have high engagement due to their interactive and branded format. This makes RCS a compelling alternative to SMS for businesses looking to enhance customer communication with rich media and real-time interactivity.

An RCS message can be created and sent like any other campaign in CleverTap, complete with targeting, scheduling, personalization, and fallback capabilities. You can also monitor campaign performance through detailed stats, including delivery rate, click-throughs, and engagement insights.

Common use cases for RCS messaging include:

- Sending utility updates such as order confirmations, delivery updates, or appointment reminders.
- Promoting offers with rich cards, carousels, and CTAs to drive user action.
- Re-engaging inactive users through visually engaging content.
- Facilitating two-way conversations for support or feedback collection.
