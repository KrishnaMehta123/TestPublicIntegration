# Overview

You can personalize the SMS title and message body for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information on user profile properties and events (dynamic replacements), refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](doc:events).

# Message Personalization

To invoke the personalization menu, type the @ symbol in the title or the text fields while creating the SMS message. It will allow you to add dynamic replacements in the SMS body.

# Catalog

Click on the ![gear icon](https://files.readme.io/d946c02-personalization_icon.png) icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

A catalog provides the ability to personalize campaigns with dynamic information in messages from product prices to inventory levels. You can create a new catalog by uploading a file with one row for each item in your catalog. A catalog can be uploaded directly on the CleverTap dashboard via a CSV file that is generated by your inventory management system on your servers. For more information on Catalogs, see [Catalogs](doc:catalog).

# Recommendations

After you have uploaded a catalog, you can display personalized recommendations to your customers. Imagine sending product recommendations with attractive offers through SMS to users who are highly interested in specific products. For more information on recommendations, refer to this detailed document on [Recommendations](doc:recommendations).

# Linked Content

Linked content provides the ability to personalize messages with rich and contextual data available outside of the CleverTap platform. With linked content, you can send messages with send-time personalization.

For example, you deliver food across different geographies and you want to personalize offers to each user based on the weather and on their location. The location can come from CleverTap personalization and the weather information can come from an API that provides the current weather. If you want to add more information, you can opt for any source such as third-party tools or in-house software to include in your message.
