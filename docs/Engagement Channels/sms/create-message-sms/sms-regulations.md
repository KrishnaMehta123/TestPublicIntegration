# Overview

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is constantly looking for ways to improve end-user experience and eliminate spam and fraudulent commercial communication. With the [TRAI regulation implementation](https://trai.gov.in/notifications/press-release/trai-releases-telecom-commercial-communication-customer-preference), it is mandated for Indian businesses using SMS to register entities, sender IDs, and SMS templates in a centralized distributed ledger technology (DLT) portal from operators.

The TRAI requires telemarketers to be registered on the DLT platform. DLT is a blockchain-based registration system to control SMS spam from various marketing firms. Previously, a registration with TRAI was enough for bulk SMS providers; however, anyone who wants to send promotional or transactional SMS to their customers must now be registered on DLT.

# Understand DLT

The DLT platform records all the transactions made by the bulk SMS providers which is required by TRAI. Communication messages such as OTP, verification codes, and notifications sent by businesses to their customers must be registered in the TRAI DLT platform. This regulation will be implemented in multiple phases. Most of the telecom operators have already implemented the blockchain-based DLT system. This system creates more transparency and reduces spam and fraud performed through SMS. CleverTap helps you meet these compliance standards.

# Bulk SMS Regulations

TRAI has formulated the guidelines to enhance control over preventing any fraudulent practice on SMS which provides greater safety for the end-customer. Clients must be registered with telecom operators to send promotional or transactional messages to their customers. They will be accountable to telecom operators who will be directly accountable to TRAI. The system is governed using blockchain technology known as DLT and the entire panel entities will be interlinked with each other.

The different types of partners involved in the process include:

### Organization

It is the organization that messages the customers. It may be an individual, partnership firm, or any private and government entity. TRAI requires every partner to be registered with the telecom operators in the DLT platform.

### End User

The end users are the mobile subscribers who receive the SMS. They can provide consent to receive promotional SMS from any business. The end user can set preferences, register complaints, and unsubscribe at any time as per the TRAI rules.

### Service Provider

The service provider is the organization that provides bulk SMS services to other organizations or companies. Every service provider must be registered on the DLT platform to send messages for these organizations or companies. 

### Telecom Operators

These are providers such as Vodafone, Airtel, Idea, BSNL, and so on. They help TRAI to enforce the regulation. 

### Regulator

The regulator such as TRAI establishes the compliance standards, audits, governs the operations to safeguard customers’ interests, and prevents fraudulent practices.

# Telemarketer or Enterprise

You can register as a telemarketer or an enterprise on the DLT platform. If you communicate with customers with SMS, then you can be classified as a telemarketer. 

The two types of telemarketers include:

* Telemarketer Aggregator: Not connected directly with the telecom operator. Can be an individual or company.
* Telemarketer Delivery: Collects SMS/voice traffic from enterprises. Directly connected with telecom operators.

Telemarketers are the main source of sales for many companies. The most common form of telemarketing is outbound sales where businesses communicate with customers through SMS or voice. Therefore, it is necessary to register on the DLT platform as a telemarketer to send promotional and transactional messages.

Also, enterprises are businesses that deal with products or services that would like to connect with customer leads through SMS to increase their sales. TRAI requires you to register your business on the DLT platform as an enterprise to communicate with your prospects via SMS.

# URL Whitelisting for SMS Marketing Campaigns

In compliance with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) regulations, all URLs included in SMS marketing campaigns must be pre-approved and whitelisted through the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platform. Additionally, shortened URLs must include the brand name to enhance transparency and ensure brand authenticity.  

This regulation aims to curb misuse of SMS services, improve accountability, and protect consumers from fraudulent communications. Non-compliance can result in SMS delivery failures, reduced campaign effectiveness, customer dissatisfaction, and potential penalties.  

Marketers using CleverTap's SMS service must ensure that all URLs in their campaigns adhere to these guidelines to avoid disruptions and ensure seamless campaign execution.

Why Whitelisting Matters:

* **Delivery Failures**: Messages with non-whitelisted URLs will be blocked by telecom operators, leading to high failure rates and reduced campaign effectiveness.
* **Reputation Risk**: Non-compliance can damage your brand’s credibility and erode customer trust.\
  By following the URL whitelisting process, marketers can ensure uninterrupted SMS delivery, build customer trust, and adhere to TRAI’s transparency and anti-fraud objectives.

By following the whitelisting process, marketers can ensure uninterrupted campaign delivery and compliance with TRAI guidelines.

## Comply with TRAI’s Short link Whitelisting Regulations

Below is a step-by-step guide to whitelisting short URLs used in SMS campaigns:

1. Log in to your operator-specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) portal (e.g., Tata Tele, Airtel, VI, or Jio) using your Principal Entity (PE) credentials.
2. Navigate to the **Whitelisting** or **Template Attribute Type** section on the portal dashboard. 

   1. Enter the **short link domain** starting with `http://` or `https://.`
   2. Add the **header** (same as the approved SMS Header for your Principal Entity)
   3. Review all details and submit the request for approval.
   4. Acknowledge and agree to TRAI’s declaration guidelines.
   5. Check the status of your request: Approved, Pending, or Rejected.
