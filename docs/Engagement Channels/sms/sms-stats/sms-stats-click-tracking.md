# Split of Clicks

You can track the click distribution on each link you include in your SMS campaign. If you want to send an SMS promotion for an upcoming movie on your video streaming app with multiple links for _reviews_, _promotions_, _movie merchandise_. We will record the clicks for each link in the SMS, and you can see them on the Campaign _Stats_ page.
