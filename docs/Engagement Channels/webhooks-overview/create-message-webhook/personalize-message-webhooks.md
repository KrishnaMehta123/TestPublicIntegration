# Overview

You can personalize the webhook payload for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information on user profile properties and events (dynamic replacements), refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](doc:events).

# Message Personalization

To personalize your campaign, click **+Key-Value Pair** and then click **@** symbol in the _Values_ field when creating the webhook.

You can also add dynamic replacements in the _Values_ field. The preview of the selected key-value pairs is displayed on the right side of the page (see figure below).

# Liquid Tags

Click the ![Liquid tag](https://files.readme.io/651c228-Liquid_tag_icon.png) icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

Liquid tags offer great flexibility in customizing key-value pairs. You can have fixed or variable values and change the content of your message by using liquid tags.

Each notification is personalized to the receiver. 

For more information on using tags, refer to [Liquid Tags](doc:liquid-tags).

# Linked Content

Linked content provides the ability to personalize webhooks.

For example, you deliver food across different geographies and you want to personalize offers to each user based on the weather and on their location. The location can come from CleverTap personalization and the weather information can come from an API that provides the current weather. If you want to add more information, you can opt for any source such as third-party tools or in-house software to include in your message.

# Catalog

Click the **Personalization** gear icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

A catalog provides the ability to personalize campaigns with dynamic information in messages from product prices to inventory levels. You can create a new catalog by uploading a file with one row for each item in your catalog. A catalog can be uploaded directly on the CleverTap dashboard via a CSV file that is generated by your inventory management system on your servers. For more information on Catalogs, see [Catalogs](doc:catalog).
