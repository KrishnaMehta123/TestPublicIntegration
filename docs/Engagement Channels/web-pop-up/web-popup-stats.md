## Split of Clicks

You can track the distribution of clicks on each CTA that you include in your Web Popup campaign. For example, you want to send a Web Popup promotion for an upcoming movie on your video streaming app. You can create a Web Popup campaign, add CTAs for reviews, promotions, movie merchandise, and more, and then send it. We will record the clicks for each CTA in the Web Popup, and you can view them on the Campaign Stats page.
