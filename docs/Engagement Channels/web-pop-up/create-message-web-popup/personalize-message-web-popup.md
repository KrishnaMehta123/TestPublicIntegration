# Overview

You can personalize the Web Popup title and message body for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information on user profile properties and events (dynamic replacements), refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](doc:events).

# Personalization

To invoke the personalization menu, type the @ symbol in the title or the text fields while creating the Web Popup message.

You can also add dynamic replacements in the Web Popup title and body. Notice a preview of the available Web Popup notification as displayed below.

In addition to the title, and the message body, you can also personalize media URLs, deep links, or button URLs. An **@** icon in a box indicates that it can be personalized.
