# Editors and Templates

There are three types of editors available:

- Basic Editor
- Custom HTML Editor
- Drag and Drop Editor

You can choose between pre-built or empty templates under _Basic Templates_. With the Drag and Drop Editor, you can save customized templates and view them under **Saved Templates**. 

# Basic Editor

You can choose from the following types of templates under Basic editor:

- **Basic Editor**
  - **Basic Templates**: Different types of popup layouts.  
  - **Ratings Templates **: Used for gathering feedback and rating.
  - **Lead Generation Templates **: Used to generate new leads by recording anonymous users' email addresses and mobile numbers. 

## Basic Templates

  At a high level, one can choose from four styles of popup layouts available under Basic Templates:

- **Box** - It is a small popup that can be placed at the desired corners of the browser window.
- **Banner**- It is a wide horizontal popup that can be placed at the top or bottom of the browser window.
- **Interstitial** - It is a center-aligned popup for driving better engagements.
- **Image only** - As the name suggests, this template can render an image as a popup on your website. The Image can have all the content like title, description, and CTA as part of it.

## Ratings Template

Marketers can now create feedback-related popups (Interstitials only) for their website users using the _Ratings Template_. 

Marketers can now create the following types of rating templates for gathering feedback from their customers:

- NPS 
- NPS with Follow-up Question
- User Rating 
- User Rating with Follow-up Question

The following images represent a sample user rating popup and an NPS popup.

        null,
        "User Star Rating Popup"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "50% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "User Ratings Popup"
    }
  ]
}

      "sizing": "50% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "NPS Ratings Popup"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Marketers get the complete flexibility to explicitly define the rating scale, style,  its shape (Star, Heart, Emojis), labels, and the overall content of the popup. One can also add a comment box to get accurate user feedback/comments. 

[block:image]

      "sizing": "70% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Define Element Style"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Besides, additional styling, such as the background color of the notification, text color, button color, and the color of the rating scale, is also possible from the editor, as shown in the image above. To learn more about tracking and monitoring user rating data, refer to the [Analyzing User Rating](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-ratings).

The web popup notification text fields in the following image can be personalized for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information, refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events).

Add all the required information. You can also flip the scale for languages that read from left to right. For example, Hebrew, Arabic, and so on.

### NPS Campaign Video Tutorial

Here's a video tutorial that demonstrates how you can create an NPS campaign on CleverTap:

[block:html]
{
  "html": "<div\n              style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                padding-bottom: 56.25%;\n                height: 0;\n                border-radius: 0;\n                box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3);\n                overflow: hidden;\n                min-width:320px\"><iframe\n              src=\"https://clevertap.portal.trainn.co/share/205P660UOtvYy6BLsVuvrg/embed?autoplay=false\"\n              frameborder=\"0\"\n              webkitallowfullscreen\n              mozallowfullscreen\n              allowfullscreen\n              allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\"\n              style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>"
}
[/block]


#### Follow-up Question Templates

A follow-up question to your ratings can provide more insights about the user experience. CleverTap provides the following Follow-up Question templates:

- NPS with Follow-up Question
- User Ratings with Follow-up Question

For example, after a user has submitted a rating on your app, you can ask follow-up questions such as _What did you like most about us?_ and provide reply choices such as Variety, Prices, Quality, Customer Service, Delivery Process, and Website Usability. This can help you get more specific feedback to improve your product and services. 

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/71b74e6-web_popup_Secondary_Tiles.jpg",
        null,
        "Short Keyword Choices"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "50% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Short Keyword-Based Choices"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can also list descriptive choices such as,_ I like the available options and variety_, _I like the quality and durability of the products_, and so on. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a95c15a-web_popup_Secondary_List.jpg",

        "Long Sentence Choices"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "50% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Descriptive Choices"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can configure the follow-up question from the Web Popup editor with a short keyword-based grid (up to six choices) or a longer sentence-based list (up to four choices).

The label will be the text you want to display to your users. If you want to allow the user to select multiple choices, select _Allow multiple selections_.

## Lead Generation Templates

We know that a significant number of website visitors remain anonymous. This poses a challenge to continue engaging with potential customers after they leave a website. A lead generation template can solve this issue. 

By integrating a lead generation form on your website, you can get important customer details such as name, email address, phone number, and so on. This information is helpful for further communication through channels such as SMS, Email, WhatsApp, and others. This post-visit communication not only helps to stay connected with your audience but also opens doors for future business opportunities. You can turn anonymous visitors into loyal customers with the CleverTap Lead Generation template.

}
[/block]


### Post Submit Actions

When a user submits information on your Lead Generation template:

- A _Notification Clicked_ event is raised that records the user's clicks on the CTA and the Close buttons.

- A custom event named _Lead Submitted_ records the details submitted by the user as event properties. Following is a sample form image: 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/0cae15f-Lead_Gen_Template_preview_with_fields.png",
        null,
        "Form Submit Actions"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "50% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Form Submit Actions"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Following is a table that records the relevant event properties for the fields displayed on the form: 

| Submitted Event Properties | Sample Property Value               |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| First Name                 | John                                |
| Last Name                  | Smith                               |
| Email ID                   | [john@abc.com](mailto:john@abc.com) |
| Phone Number               | \+11234567890                       |
| Campaign ID                | 121110987654                        |
| Variant                    | wzrk_default                        |

- The user profile is automatically updated with the submitted event properties. For example, the lead generation template can ask for additional details from an anonymous user, such as first name, last name, email, and phone number. His profile will be updated with these details, and now you can identify the user as _John Smith_. 

### Lead Generation Template Variants

The Lead Generation template has the following three variants:

- Text Only
- Image On Side
- Image On Top

 A Custom HTML Editor is used to create templates with custom HTML scripts. Users have a choice to customize their popup's appearance using the Box, Banner, and Interstitial templates. Insert the custom HTML scripts for the respective template layout in the HTML editor.

You can check how the content will display on a mobile phone without going to Previews or sending a test message. Any changes made to the mobile view will be reflected on the desktop view as well. It is a What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor.

    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/726f50a-image.png",
        null,
        "Advanced customizationf or popups"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "50% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Advanced customization of web pop-up"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


- _Layout_:  Select the appropriate option to display the popup in the center of the page, bottom-right, top-left, and so on.
- _Popup Size_: A popup size must be relevant to the page. Select the appropriate width for your popup on mobile and desktop. The height is adjusted automatically. 
- _Card Style_: Select if the popup should have rounded corners, borders, and also select the background color. 
- _Close icon_: Select the icon's color to close the popup. For example, a black icon is distinctly visible on a white popup. 
- _Overlay style_: An overlay keeps you focused on the popup content without distracting user from the rest of the website content. Generally, the overlay is used for centered or interstitial layouts by increasing the opacity of the background. A higher opacity will make the popup more visible, while a lower opacity can provide a subtle hint at the content without overpowering the user's attention. Opacity can vary depending on the design and purpose of the popup. It's essential to test different opacities to find the best balance for your design and audience. Select if you want to add an overlay and then its opacity. 

### Save A Template

This step is optional. You can choose to save a template for future use. Click **Save template**.

# On Click Actions

The _On Click Actions_ feature allows customers to trigger specific actions (such as opening a link, running a function, and so on) when a user clicks a web popup or the button within the popup. This functionality is essential for creating interactive and dynamic web experiences, giving customers greater control over how elements behave in response to user interactions.
