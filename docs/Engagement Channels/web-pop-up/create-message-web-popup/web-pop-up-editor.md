# Overview

The Web Pop-up Editor is a feature available when building a Web Pop-up message in CleverTap. It enables you to add content to pre-built templates or customize and build them. After creating a Web Pop-up template, you can use it in the current campaign or save it for future campaigns.

From the *What* section in the Web Pop-up builder, Select Message Type and click **Go to Editor**.  

The Web Pop-up Editor tool displays.

<Image title="Email Editor Templates" alt={1424} align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/2199a47-Web_popup_Editors.jpg" /> Select Web Pop-up Editor Type

# Editors and Templates

There are three types of editors available:

* Basic Editor
* Custom HTML Editor
* Drag and Drop Editor

You can choose between pre-built or empty templates under *Basic Templates*. With the Drag and Drop Editor, you can save customized templates and view them under **Saved Templates**. 

# Basic Editor

You can choose from the following types of templates under Basic editor:

* **Basic Editor**
  * **Basic Templates**: Different types of popup layouts.  
  * **Ratings Templates** : Used for gathering feedback and rating.
  * **Lead Generation Templates** : Used to generate new leads by recording anonymous users' email addresses and mobile numbers. 

## Basic Templates

At a high level, one can choose from four styles of popup layouts available under Basic Templates:

* **Box** - It is a small popup that can be placed at the desired corners of the browser window.
* **Banner**- It is a wide horizontal popup that can be placed at the top or bottom of the browser window.
* **Interstitial** - It is a center-aligned popup for driving better engagements.
* **Image only** - As the name suggests, this template can render an image as a popup on your website. The Image can have all the content like title, description, and CTA as part of it.

## Ratings Template

Marketers can now create feedback-related popups (Interstitials only) for their website users using the *Ratings Template*. 

Marketers can now create the following types of rating templates for gathering feedback from their customers:

* NPS 
* NPS with Follow-up Question
* User Rating 
* User Rating with Follow-up Question

The following images represent a sample user rating popup and an NPS popup.

<Image alt="User Star Rating Popup" align="center" width="50% " border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/4062d44-Web_Popup_NPS_rating_Star.jpg" /> User Ratings Popup
<Image alt="NPS Popup" align="center" width="50% " border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/ce8fb86-Web_Popup_NPS_rating_Numbered.jpg" />  NPS Ratings Popup











Marketers get the complete flexibility to explicitly define the rating scale, style,  its shape (Star, Heart, Emojis), labels, and the overall content of the popup. One can also add a comment box to get accurate user feedback/comments. 

<Image title="Edit Style" alt={1710} align="center" width="70% " border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/7bbc6cc-styling.png" />  Define Element Style











Besides, additional styling, such as the background color of the notification, text color, button color, and the color of the rating scale, is also possible from the editor, as shown in the image above. To learn more about tracking and monitoring user rating data, refer to the [Analyzing User Rating](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-ratings).

The web popup notification text fields in the following image can be personalized for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information, refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events).

Add all the required information. You can also flip the scale for languages that read from left to right. For example, Hebrew, Arabic, and so on.

### NPS Campaign Video Tutorial

Here's a video tutorial that demonstrates how you can create an NPS campaign on CleverTap:

<HTMLBlock>{`
<div
              style="
                position: relative;
                padding-bottom: 56.25%;
                height: 0;
                border-radius: 0;
                box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3);
                overflow: hidden;
                min-width:320px"><iframe
              src="https://clevertap.portal.trainn.co/share/205P660UOtvYy6BLsVuvrg/embed?autoplay=false"
              frameborder="0"

              style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>`}</HTMLBlock>


#### Follow-up Question Templates
A follow-up question to your ratings can provide more insights about the user experience. CleverTap provides the following Follow-up Question templates:

* NPS with Follow-up Question
* User Ratings with Follow-up Question

For example, after a user has submitted a rating on your app, you can ask follow-up questions such as *What did you like most about us?* and provide reply choices such as Variety, Prices, Quality, Customer Service, Delivery Process, and Website Usability. This can help you get more specific feedback to improve your product and services.

<Image alt="Short Keyword Choices" align="center" width="50%" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/71b74e6-web_popup_Secondary_Tiles.jpg" /> Short Keyword-Based Choices

You can also list descriptive choices such as, *I like the available options and variety*, *I like the quality and durability of the products*, and so on.

<Image alt="Long Sentence Choices" align="center" width="50%" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/a95c15a-web_popup_Secondary_List.jpg" /> Descriptive Choices

You can configure the follow-up question from the Web Popup editor with a short keyword-based grid (up to six choices) or a longer sentence-based list (up to four choices).

The label will be the text you want to display to your users. If you want to allow the user to select multiple choices, select *Allow multiple selections*.

<Image alt="Configure Follow-up Popup" align="center" width="80%" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/fd33f9a-image_18.png" /> Configure Follow-up Popup

> 📘 Note
>
> In the case of the User Ratings template, the *Notification Clicked* event is raised that records the user's clicks on the CTA buttons and the Close button.

## Lead Generation Templates

We know that a significant number of website visitors remain anonymous. This poses a challenge to continue engaging with potential customers after they leave a website. A lead generation template can solve this issue.
By integrating a lead generation form on your website, you can get important customer details such as name, email address, phone number, and so on. This information is helpful for further communication through channels such as SMS, Email, WhatsApp, and others. This post-visit communication not only helps to stay connected with your audience but also opens doors for future business opportunities. You can turn anonymous visitors into loyal customers with the CleverTap Lead Generation template.

### Post Submit Actions

When a user submits information on your Lead Generation template:

* A *Notification Clicked* event is raised that records the user's clicks on the CTA and the Close buttons.

* A custom event named *Lead Submitted* records the details submitted by the user as event properties. Following is a sample form image: 

<Image alt="Form Submit Actions" align="center" width="50% " border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/0cae15f-Lead_Gen_Template_preview_with_fields.png" /> Form Submit Actions

Following is a table that records the relevant event properties for the fields displayed on the form:
| Submitted Event Properties | Sample Property Value               |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| First Name                 | John                                |
| Last Name                  | Smith                               |
| Email ID                   | [john@abc.com](mailto:john@abc.com) |
| Phone Number               | \+11234567890                       |
| Campaign ID                | 121110987654                        |
| Variant                    | wzrk\_default                       |

* The user profile is automatically updated with the submitted event properties. For example, the lead generation template can ask for additional details from an anonymous user, such as first name, last name, email, and phone number. His profile will be updated with these details, and now you can identify the user as *John Smith*. 

### Lead Generation Template Variants

The Lead Generation template has the following three variants:

* Text Only
* Image On Side
* Image On Top

>
> If you are already raising the Notification Clicked event manually in your template, then ensure to disable the *Enable click tracking for Custom HTML* checkbox to avoid overcounting.

To track the campaign stats, such as the number of total clicks and CTRs, marketers must select the *Enable click tracking for Custom HTML* checkbox.

## Template Operations

### Advanced Customization

You can customize a template further to update the Web Pop-up display. 

Click the **Advanced customization** button from the template editor to update the display. You can change the following settings:

<Image alt="Advanced customizationf or popups" align="center" width="50%" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/726f50a-image.png" /> Advanced customization of web pop-up
* *Layout*:  Select the appropriate option to display the popup in the center of the page, bottom-right, top-left, and so on.
* *Popup Size*: A popup size must be relevant to the page. Select the appropriate width for your popup on mobile and desktop. The height is adjusted automatically. 
* *Card Style*: Select if the popup should have rounded corners, borders, and also select the background color. 
* *Close icon*: Select the icon's color to close the popup. For example, a black icon is distinctly visible on a white popup. 
* *Overlay style*: An overlay keeps you focused on the popup content without distracting user from the rest of the website content. Generally, the overlay is used for centered or interstitial layouts by increasing the opacity of the background. A higher opacity will make the popup more visible, while a lower opacity can provide a subtle hint at the content without overpowering the user's attention. Opacity can vary depending on the design and purpose of the popup. It's essential to test different opacities to find the best balance for your design and audience. Select if you want to add an overlay and then its opacity. 

### Save A Template

This step is optional. You can choose to save a template for future use. Click **Save template**.

<Image title="Save a Template for Future Use" alt="Save a Template" align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/37acd05-save_template.jpg" />  Save a Template











2. Name your template and click Save.

Your template is now saved under the **Saved Templates**  tab.
