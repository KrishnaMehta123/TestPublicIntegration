It is divided into two main sections:

# Element Operations

This section explains how to add, layer, remove, and edit elements in the Advanced Web Pop-up Builder. In the Advanced Web Pop-up Builder, _Elements_ are the core components used to construct your message. You can perform the following operations:

- [Device Previews](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/advanced-web-pop-up-builder#device-previews)
- [Add New Elements](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/advanced-web-pop-up-builder#add-new-elements)
- [Layer Elements](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/advanced-web-pop-up-builder#layer-elements)
- [Remove Elements](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/advanced-web-pop-up-builder#remove-elements)
- [Edit Elements](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/advanced-web-pop-up-builder#edit-elements)
  - Text
  - Image
  - Button
  - Container

## Device Previews

Toggle between Desktop and Mobile device views to create the Popups for desktop and mobile users:

- **Desktop**: Use the Device Preview list to preview the pop-up across various screen widths, such as 320px, 768px, or 1024px. This helps ensure responsive behavior on different browser sizes.
- **Mobile**: Select the phone or tablet from the Device Preview list to preview the pop-up on a range of phone and tablet models. This allows you to tailor the experience based on screen dimensions and device form factors.

## Add New Elements

You can enhance your Web Pop-up message by adding elements and using the available styling options to ensure it aligns with your brand's style/aesthetics. Click **Add** on the canvas to insert one of the following elements:

- **Text**: Add text to convey your message. 
- **Image**: Incorporate visuals or branding images to create an engaging experience. Image elements can also function as buttons, enabling call-to-actions directly from the image.
- **Button**: Create call-to-action buttons, such as _Buy Now_ or_ Learn More_, with precise control over the design and positioning.
- **Container**: Hold all the content, such as text, images, and buttons, and determine the layout structure.

- Click **Send Backward** to push it behind other elements.

## Add Animations

Animations enhance visual appeal and improve user experience. The builder provides built-in animation options for the **Container** element.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4e6849faba89920ee2272087500aa47889d47d1969d91cac8404f5fbb2a0eb4b-2025-08-02_21-21-32_2.gif",
        null,
        "Animation"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": " Design Animation"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


From the Container element, configure various animation options as follows:

- **Animation types**: Choose from Instant (default), Dissolve, or Move In animations.
- **Duration**: Duration is set in milliseconds, allowing you to experiment with different values and observe the effect in the canvas.
- **Easing**: Following options are available for Dissolve and Move In animations.

| Easing Options  | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear          | Moves at a constant speed from start to finish, creating a uniform motion.                                                                          |
| Ease In         | Fades in, creating a smooth entrance.                                                                                                               |
| Ease Out        | Fades out, creating a smooth exit.                                                                                                                  |
| Ease In and Out | Fades in and out from start to finish.                                                                                                              |

# Configuring Web Pop-up Campaigns

Once the Web Pop-up is designed using the builder, you can set up the Web Pop-up campaign to control when, where, and to whom the pop-up is displayed. These targeting and delivery rules are defined during the campaign creation process. 

For more information on how to configure these options, refer to [Create Message](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/create-message-web-popup).

# FAQs

### Can I stack images, buttons, and text?

Yes. Use the Bring Forward and Send Backward options to control the visual layering of elements.

### Can I preview my Web Pop-up before launch?

The _Preview and Test_ feature is currently unavailable for the Builder. To test your Web Pop-up message on a real device, exclusively send the campaign to a specific test user or segment for testing. After you are done testing, recreate the campaign and send it to your intended audience. For more information on test users, refer to [Mark a User Profile as a Test Profile](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles#mark-a-user-profile-as-a-test-profile).

### What happens if I only configure the desktop version and not the mobile version, or vice versa?

The Desktop and Mobile sections are independent of each other and you must explicitly configure pop-ups for both device types. Pop-ups created for desktop do not automatically adapt to mobile, and vice versa. 

### Is Liquid Tag personalization supported in the Advanced builder?

Yes. Liquid Tags are supported, allowing you to personalize content dynamically within your Web Pop-up campaigns. For more information, refer to [Liquid Tags](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/liquid-tags).
