# Overview

You can send email campaigns to all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created based on past or live user behavior, user properties, or a combination of user behavior and properties. For more information on segments, refer to  [Segment](doc:segment-overview). Once you send a campaign, you can view detailed reports of the messages sent and how many users converted due to the campaign.
