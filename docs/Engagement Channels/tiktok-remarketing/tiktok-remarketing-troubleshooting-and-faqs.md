Here’s a concise guide of troubleshooting tips and frequently asked questions to help you address common issues with TikTok remarketing.

### 1. What does "Audience not found" mean?

This message indicates that the TikTok audience linked to your account no longer exists. This typically occurs if the account manager has deleted the audience from the TikTok account.

### 2. Why am I seeing "Couldn't Fetch Audience Size"?

This error happens when we attempt to fetch the audience size from TikTok, but the APIs fail to return a response. It may be a temporary issue with TikTok's system, so you may want to try again later.

### 3. Why is my audience size showing as 0?

There are a couple of reasons why the audience size might appear as zero:

- **Audience Not Matched Yet:** If you've recently uploaded an audience, it may take 24-48 hours for the size to update on the Audiences page in TikTok’s Ads Manager.
- **Matched User Count is Less Than 1000:** For privacy reasons, TikTok will show the audience size as 0 if the matched user count is below 1000.

### 4. How long does it take for uploaded audiences to reflect in TikTok Ads Manager?

Typically, audience sizes will update within 24-48 hours after an audience is uploaded to TikTok.

### 5. What should I do if my audience size does not update?

If your audience size remains unchanged after 48 hours, consider reaching out to your account manager for further assistance and troubleshooting.

### 6. Can I request the TikTok remarketing feature?

Yes, this feature is in private beta. You can contact your account manager to request access to enable TikTok remarketing for your account.

### 7. Are there any limitations to using TikTok remarketing?

Yes, please be aware of the 1000-user minimum requirement for audience size visibility. Additionally, if an audience is deleted or if there are issues fetching data from TikTok's API, you may encounter related messages.

### 8. Where can I find more information about managing audiences on TikTok?

You can refer to TikTok's official documentation or reach out to your account manager for specific inquiries regarding audience management and best practices.

If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to contact your account manager or refer to the support resources available.
