# Connect TikTok Ad Account

After successfully implementing the steps, your TikTok ad account will be integrated into CleverTap.

## Reconnect Ad Account

A **token expiration** occurs when the authentication token that allows your account to connect with CleverTap reaches its validity limit. Tokens are designed to be temporary for security reasons; once expired, they can no longer be used to access the account. This helps protect your data from unauthorized access.

If the token expires, your account may become disconnected, and the status column on the CleverTap dashboard will show *Disconnected*. When you hover over this status, a *Refresh* option will appear. Click **Refresh** to reconnect your account.
