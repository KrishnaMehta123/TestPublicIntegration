**Use Cases:**

Integrating your TikTok ad account with CleverTap increases targeted marketing and audience engagement opportunities. Here’s how you can leverage this integration:

1. **Product Retargeting:** If a user viewed a product but did not make a purchase, you can retarget them with personalized ads showcasing that product or similar items, increasing the likelihood of conversion.

2. **Abandoned Cart Recovery:** For users who added items to their cart but did not complete the purchase, targeted ads can remind and offer them incentives to finalize the transaction.

3. **Customer Re-engagement:** Users who have interacted with your brand’s content in the past but have become inactive can be retargeted with fresh, engaging content or special offers to reignite their interest.

4. **Lookalike Audience Expansion** By analyzing the behaviors of users who have successfully converted, you can create lookalike audiences on TikTok to reach new potential customers with similar characteristics and interests.

5. **Event Promotion:** For events or special promotions, you can target users who have previously engaged with your brand or similar events, ensuring your promotions reach an audience more likely to attend or participate.

With CleverTap's advanced segmentation capabilities, you can effectively create and export target audiences tailored to your business goals, optimizing your remarketing efforts on TikTok.
