# Overview

The RCS Message Editor in CleverTap allows marketers to create and manage Rich Communication Services (RCS) messages as part of SMS campaigns. These messages support multimedia content, rich formatting, and interactive buttons, enabling businesses to deliver high-impact communication directly to users' messaging apps.

Templates can be created once and reused across multiple campaigns, improving consistency and reducing setup time.

To access the RCS Message Editor:

1. In the SMS Campaign Builder, go to the **Provider** dropdown, select **RCS Message Provider**.

The RCS Message Template selection screen will appear, where you can create or edit templates for your campaign.

## Template Creation Modes

CleverTap supports two modes for working with RCS templates, based on your telecom carrier and campaign regulations:

### Approved Templates 

For carriers where template approval is required, RCS templates must be [created](doc:rcs-setup#create-template) and submitted in advance. Once approved:

* Template content and button fields are locked.
* Only dynamic placeholder values (e.g., `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`) can be filled at the campaign level.
* This ensures compliance with telecom regulations.

When using an approved template in the editor, you will see fields pre-filled with static content or placeholderCleverTap supports two modes for working with RCS templates, depending on your region and the regulatory requirements enforced by telecom carriers and campaign compliance guidelines.s. Your role is to supply the appropriate values for those placeholders during campaign setup.

### Free-form Templates 

In regions where template approval is not required, you can build templates directly in the editor. These templates allow full flexibility:

* You define all text, media, button behavior, and placeholders.
* There are no locked fields.
* You are responsible for entering all information correctly.

This documentation explains every component clearly to support both workflows.

## RCS Template Types

CleverTap provides three types of RCS templates. Each supports text, personalization through placeholders, and interactive buttons.

### [Text Template](doc:rcs-message-editor#text-template-1)

A simple, text-only format. Useful for alerts, reminders, and announcements.

* **Media Support**: No
* **Interactive Buttons**: Yes

### [Rich Card Template](doc:rcs-message-editor#rich-card-template-1)

A more visual format that allows an image or video, along with a title, body text, and buttons.

* **Media Support**: Yes
* **Interactive Buttons**: Yes

## Button Types in RCS Messages

Buttons allow users to interact with your message. All three RCS templates support three button types:

* [URL Redirect  ](doc:rcs-message-editor#url-redirect-button)
* [Dialer  ](doc:rcs-message-editor#dialer-button)
* [Quick Reply  ](doc:rcs-message-editor#quick-reply-button)

Each button includes specific fields that must be configured. Depending on your template type, these fields may be locked (approved templates) or editable (free-form templates).

### URL Redirect Button

This button opens a web page when tapped. There are three configurations:

* [Static URL](doc:rcs-message-editor#static-url)

## Template Types

Now that you understand how buttons work and how their fields behave depending on your template type, the next step is to configure the structure of the RCS message itself using templates. Templates define how the message appears—text-only, rich content, or multiple scrollable cards—and they determine where your buttons and dynamic content appear.

All three template types - **Text**, **Rich Card**, and **Carousel**—support the same button types (URL Redirect, Dialer, Quick Reply). The difference lies in how the content is organized and how fields behave for different types of users.

Depending on your region or setup, you may be using:

* **Approved Templates** (e.g., in India): Created in advance and submitted for approval. Most content fields are locked, and only dynamic values (e.g., `{{1}}`) can be updated in the campaign.
* **Free-form Templates** (e.g., outside India): Created directly in the RCS Message Editor with full control over layout, text, media, and button configuration.

Each template is explained below in detail.
