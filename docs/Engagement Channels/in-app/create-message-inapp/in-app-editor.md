# In-App Templates

The following are the four main types of In-App templates for creating engaging and personalized In-App campaigns:

* [_Basic Templates_](doc:in-app-editor#basic-templates)
* [_Ratings Templates_ ](doc:in-app-editor#ratings-template)
* [_Lead Generation Templates_](doc:in-app-editor#lead-generation-template)
* [_Custom HTML Templates_](doc:in-app-editor#custom-templates)

## Basic Templates:

Basic Templates are ready-to-use templates that enable you to send tailored and personalized In-App engagements to your mobile users. You can use both text and images with CTAs to send personalized In-App messages basis your business use case.

Using basic templates, you can create the following two types of In-App messages:

* [Content with Image notifications](doc:in-app-editor#content-with-image-notifications)
* [Image-only notifications](doc:in-app-editor#image-only-notifications)

### Content with Image notifications

These templates allow you to use images in combination with text for effective messaging. You can choose from a range of templates such as _Cover_, _Half Interstitial_, _Interstitial_, _Header_, _Footer_, and _Alert_  based on your use case.

### Image-only notifications

These templates allow you to send visually engaging images that can quickly capture users' attention and encourage them to engage with the message when they launch the app. When selecting an _image only_ template, you can send a message containing only an image (without CTAs, title, or message).

You can choose from the following four types of Image only notifications:

#### Cover

It is a full-screen notification template that is valuable when the intention is to direct the user's focus toward essential actions, such as requiring them to install a necessary app update.

#### Half Interstitial

It is a center-aligned image notification template for driving better engagements. You can use this template when you want to gain the user's attention towards a sale or discount.

#### Interstitial

It is a center-aligned image notification template you can use for driving better engagements on app launch.

#### Image Interstitial

> 📘 Availability
>
> The **Image Interstitial** template is available only with CleverTap Advanced and Cutting Edge plans.

This template helps craft personalized In-App messages that seamlessly match your app's aesthetics. You upload an image and elevate the experience by incorporating up to 10 interactive hotspots, each with its own unique actions. For example, you can use this template to create a rewarding offer for your gaming app users. The following image represents a sample In-App campaign for rewarding users using the Image Interstitial template:

<Image align="center" alt="Sample In-App Campaign using Image Interstitial Template" border={true} caption="Sample In-App Campaign using Image Interstitial Template" src="https://files.readme.io/7da5c6a-Image_Interstitial_full.png" />

The Image Interstitial template primarily comprises the following three elements:

* Overlay: This element is a middle layer between your In-App message and your app in the background. By default, it is transparent; however, you can select a color of your choice or upload an image to it. Using the Overlay configuration, you can:
  * Opt for a semi-transparent color to softly mask the app in the background, drawing more attention to the in-app message in the foreground.
  * Upload a patterned image to create a captivating, full-screen, layered in-app message experience.
* Content: It is the core element of the template. Click in the center of a blank device or select the **Content** option from the _Element_ dropdown to activate it. Further, upload an image (JPG, PNG, or GIF) consisting of all In-App message elements such as background, text, and buttons.  
  The editor fits the image within the Content container while preserving its aspect ratio without any cropping. By default, a 10% margin is applied to the Content container. However, you can change that from the _Margin_ field.
* Buttons:  The Image Interstitial buttons are transparent regions that you can place over a Content layer. You can easily move and adjust their size to align with the button elements on the image.

The selection area within the Content Container automatically adapts to various device screen sizes, eliminating the need to create multiple versions for different devices. To see how the image and buttons scale across different aspect ratios, use the dropdown menu with different device viewport sizes located at the top for a preview.

> 📘 Preview & Test
>
> * The _Preview & Test_ feature for sending tests on the device is not available for iOS or Android SDK versions lower than **6.0.0** and Unity **3.0.0.** If you need to test on a device with a lower SDK version, send the campaign exclusively to the user first, and then recreate and send it to the intended audience.

#### File Size Guidelines

* **Image**: Less than 500 kb.
* **Audio**: Less than 5 Mb.
* **Video**: Less than 50 Mb.

#### Message Character Limit

| Language | Title           | Message          |
| :------- | :-------------- | :--------------- |
| English  | 30              | 128              |
| Chinese  | 9 (Approximate) | 38 (Approximate) |

> 🚧 Image Cropping
>
> Due to the multiple phone sizes on both Android and iOS, we will center crop images if the image does not fit the screen resolution.  
> We scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the phone (minus padding). The image is then center-aligned.
>
> **Image Cropping does not apply for Image Interstitial template.**

> 🚧 Video Messages
>
> When adding video messages to In-App, ensure an audio track is always present.  
> If required, insert a blank audio track to the video.

## Ratings Template

Marketers can now create feedback-related popups for their mobile app users using the _Ratings Template._  
They can now create two types of rating templates for gaining feedback from their customers:

* User Rating Popup - It helps assess how happy your customers are with your services by taking feedback in the form of star ratings.
* NPS Popup - It enables you to measure the loyalty of your customers by distinguishing them in three categories - **Promoters**, **Passives**, **Detractors**.  One can view the NPS performance by navigating to the [NPS board](doc:nps-board) available under the _Boards_ section.

The following images represent a sample _User Rating Popup_ and _NPS popup_ in a mobile app.

<Image align="center" alt={568} border={true} caption="User Ratings Popup" title="Capture User Rating" src="https://files.readme.io/cc3f275-inapp.png" width="40% " />

<Image align="center" alt={542} border={true} caption="NPS Popup" title="Capture NPS" src="https://files.readme.io/3d18243-in-app_nps.png" width="40% " />

Marketers get the complete flexibility to explicitly define the rating scale, style, shape (Star, Heart, Emojis), labels, and the overall content of the popup. One can also choose to add a comment box to get accurate user feedback/comments.

<Image align="center" alt={2044} border={true} caption="In-App Editor Style" title="Style Rating Template Elements" src="https://files.readme.io/d76e790-in_app_styles.png" />

Besides, additional styling, such as configuring the color for the message, question, background, and rating scale is also possible from the editor, as shown in the image above. The In-App notification text fields shown below can be personalized for every user based on specific user property or event property values. To learn more about tracking and monitoring user rating data, refer to [Analysing User Rating](doc:user-ratings).

<Image align="center" alt={1694} border={true} caption="Compose In-App Message" title="Compose In-App Message for Ratings Template" src="https://files.readme.io/ae7f02c-rate.png" />

### Follow-up Question Templates

A follow-up question to your ratings can provide more insights about the user experience. CleverTap provides the following Follow-up Question templates:

* NPS with Follow-up Question
* User Ratings with Follow-up Question

For example, after a user has submitted a rating on your app, you can ask follow-up questions such as _What did you like most about us?_ and provide reply choices such as Variety, Prices, Quality, Customer Service, Delivery Process, and Website Usability. This can help you get more specific feedback to improve your product and services. Following is an image from the in-app editor:

<Image align="center" alt="Short Keyword Choices" border={true} caption="Short Keyword-Based Choices" src="https://files.readme.io/4766cd8-inapp_followup_nps.jpg" width="50% " />

You can also list descriptive choices such as, _I like the available options and variety_, _I like the quality and durability of the products_, and so on. Following is an image from the in-app editor:

<Image align="center" alt="Long Sentence Choices" border={true} caption="Descriptive Choices" src="https://files.readme.io/0decade-inapp_followup_qs_list.jpg" width="50% " />

You can configure the follow-up question from the Web Popup editor with a short keyword-based grid (up to six choices) or a longer sentence-based list (up to four choices).

The label will be the text you want to display to your users. If you want to allow the user to select multiple choices, select _Allow multiple selections_.

<Image align="center" alt="Configure Follow-up Popup" border={true} caption="Configure Follow-up Popup" src="https://files.readme.io/fd33f9a-image_18.png" width="80% " />

> 📘 Note
>
> In the case of the User Ratings template, the _Notification Clicked_ event is raised that records the user's clicks on the CTA buttons and the Close button

## Lead Generation Template

We know that a significant number of App users may remain anonymous. This poses a challenge to continue engaging with potential customers after they leave your App. A lead generation template can solve this issue.

Integrating a lead generation form into your App lets you get important customer details such as name, email address, phone number, etc. This information is helpful for further communication through channels such as SMS, Email, WhatsApp, and others. This post-visit communication helps stay connected with your audience and opens doors for future business opportunities. You can turn anonymous visitors into loyal customers with your App's CleverTap Lead Generation Template.

<Image align="center" alt="Sample Lead Generation Template" border={true} caption="Sample Lead Generation Template" src="https://files.readme.io/3658161-InApp_Lead_Gen_sample_window.png" width="40% " />

### Post Submit Actions

When a user submits information on your Lead Generation template:

* A _Notification Clicked_ event is raised that records the click on the CTA.

* A custom event named _Lead Submitted_ records the details submitted by the user as of event properties. Following is a sample form image:

<Image align="center" alt="Form Submit Actions" border={false} caption="Form Submit Actions" src="https://files.readme.io/0cae15f-Lead_Gen_Template_preview_with_fields.png" width="50% " />

Following is a table that records the relevant properties for the fields displayed on the form:

| Submitted Event Properties | Sample Property Value               |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| First Name                 | John                                |
| Last Name                  | Smith                               |
| Email ID                   | [john@abc.com](mailto:john@abc.com) |
| Phone Number               | +11234567890                        |
| Campaign ID                | 121110987654                        |
| Variant                    | wzrk_default                        |

* The user profile is automatically updated with the submitted event properties. For example, the lead generation template can ask for additional details from an anonymous user, such as first name, last name, email, and phone number. His profile will be updated with these details, and now you can identify the user as _John Smith_.

### Lead Generation Template Variants

The following are the two types of Lead Generation templates:

* **Text**: You can create a text-only lead generation template to record user information.
* **Image on Top**: You can add an image on the top to the lead generation template.

Create the content to record information from your users. The following image displays a preview of the form:

<Image align="center" alt="Create Lead Generation Template" border={true} caption="Create Lead Generation Template" src="https://files.readme.io/035a137-lead_gen.png" />

Select the button style and card positions from the _Style_ tab.

* _Buttons_: The _Close_ button is selected by default. Add a button name such as _Submit_ or _Upload_.
* _Subtext_: Add subtext such as _privacy policy_ to your lead generation template.

<Image align="center" alt="Add Subtext" border={true} caption="Add Subtext" title="Lead Gen Template SubText preview.png" src="https://files.readme.io/bb6e1f2-Lead_Gen_Template_SubText_preview.png" width="55% " />

The hyperlinked part must be closed between two asterisks. Add the URL where the user will be directed. You can also add a checkbox for your subtext.

<Image align="center" alt="Subtext and redirect URL" border={true} caption="Subtext and redirect URL" title="Lead Gen Template SubText.png" src="https://files.readme.io/d740b86-Lead_Gen_Template_SubText.png" width="55% " />

* _Acknowledgement_: You can show appreciation to your user by adding an Acknowledgement popup. Select the auto-close timer for the popup.

Select the button style and card positions from the _Style_ tab.

  ### Configurable Settings in Template Explained

  The following is a description of the customizable variables in CleverTap's Spin the Wheel gamification template.

  #### includeDismissButton

  ```js
  includeDismissButton: true,
  ```

  #### background

  Defines the background style of the spin screen. You can use a flat color or a gradient to match your campaign theme.

  ```js
  background: "linear-gradient(180deg, #FF3672 0%, #8332F9 46.63%, #6708BC 84.62%, #4E15DD 100%)",

  ```js
  spinDurationSeconds: 5,

    enabled: true,
    text: "Spin Now",
    background: "#ffffff",
    color: "#1d1d1d",
  },
  ```

  #### claimButton

  Configure the button that appears after a spin. You can drive users to a landing page or apply a reward using a custom link.

  ```js
  claimButton: {
    enabled: true,
    text: "Collect Now",
    background: "#F4357D",
    color: "#ffffff",
    url: "wzkr://thisleadstonowhere",
  },
  ```

  #### mainTitle

  Control the headline at the top of the spin modal. Use this to grab attention with bold and fun messaging.

  ```js
  mainTitle: {
    text: "🎉 Spin the Wheel <br>& Win Big!",
    fontSize: "24px",
    color: "#ffffff",
  },
  ```

  #### subtitle

  Add supportive messaging under the title. This is where you reinforce the benefit (for example, savings, gifts, exclusives).

  ```js
  subtitle: {
    text: "Your chance to score discounts, free gifts, and exclusive perks is just a spin away.",
    fontSize: "14px",
    color: "#e8f5ff",
  },
  ```

  #### copyInstruction

  Set the message and color when users copy a reward code. You can highlight that the code was successfully copied.

  ```js
  copyInstruction: {
    color: "#606060",
    copiedColor: "#F4357D",
  },
  ```

  #### centerCircle

  Adjust the style of the central hub of the wheel (the spinner core). You can tweak the color, border, and size to match your brand.

  ```js
  centerCircle: {
    color: "#914DFF",
    borderColor: "#2B2B2B33",
    borderWidth: 2,
    radius: 15,
  },
  ```

  #### rewards

  It is the core of the experience. Each entry defines a reward slice on the wheel: what it says, the code it provides, a description, color, and the chance it gets selected. Check that the probabilities add up reasonably (they don’t need to equal 1).

  ```js
  rewards: [
    {
      title: "Congrats! You just won a Promo Code!",
      text: "10% OFF",
      value: "DISCOUNT10",
      subtitle: "Use DISCOUNT10 at checkout to get 10% off your order. Valid through April 30.",
      probability: 0.15,
      colour: "#ffffff",
    },
    {
      title: "Congrats! You just won a Free Shipping!",
      text: "Free Shipping",
      value: "FREESHIP",
      subtitle: "Use FREESHIP at checkout to enjoy free shipping on your order. Valid through April 30.",
      probability: 0.15,
      colour: "#fc2b46",
    },
    // Add more rewards as needed
  ],
  ```
</details>

* Use high-contrast text over bright gradients for readability.
* Add expiration dates in reward subtext to create urgency.
* Use consistent reward identifiers across campaigns for tracking.

# Time to Live (TTL)

You can configure the number of days (or hours) to keep the message on the user's device by setting the _time to live_.

<Image align="center" alt={630} border={true} caption="Time to Live for a Message" title="Configure Time to Live for In-App Message" src="https://files.readme.io/35148df-in-app_time_to_live.png" />

The TTL can range from 1 day to 365 days. The default value for TTL is two days. The message on the user's device stays there for the specified TTL, after which it is automatically removed.

> 🚧 Choosing the Right TTL
>
> You should choose a TTL that resonates with the purpose of your campaign. Some messages need to stay on the user's device for a longer period (coupon codes which are valid for a month) while some should last for a day or two (weekend discount offers).

# In-App Editor

Use the In-App editor to craft your In-app campaign with the desired messaging and styling best suited for your business. You can choose from a range of In-App templates. Alternatively, you can also use the Custom HTML option to build your own campaign.

The elements of the editor vary based on the type of template you select for creating your In-App campaign.

The following image represents the _Content with image notifications_ template editor.

<Image align="center" alt={1206} border={true} caption="In-App Editor for Content with Image notifications" title="Basic Editor" src="https://files.readme.io/6b590c3-in-app_editor.png" width="80%" />

At a high level, the In-App editor has the following two primary sections: _Content_ and _Style_.

### Content

The Content section allows you to define your In-App message's overall text and visual content. Use this section to create engaging, and personalized In-App messages by entering enticing Title and Message. To [personalize](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/personalize-message-inapp) the message, click the **Personalization (@)**  icon in the _Title_ and _Description_ fields.

Using the _Insert image_ option, you can upload the desired image to make your In-App campaign visually appealing when the app is in Portrait or Landscape mode.

You can choose to add the same image with different form factors or completely different images to give a unique experience on portrait and landscape.

Additionally, you can add up to two CTAs and configure their On Click Action as per your requirement. You can use the following three types of action buttons:

* Close notification: It closes the notification after a tap.
* Open URL: A special type of CTA that enables the user to open a deep link for Android or iOS.
* Custom key-value pairs: The key-value pairs send back custom data when a user clicks the in-app button

You can also configure the number of days (or hours) to keep the In-App message on the user's device by setting the Message Time to Live field as per your use case.

> 📘 Image Interstitial Template Exception
>
> The elements of the In-App editor for the _Image only notifications_ templates are similar to those of the  _Content with Image notifications_ templates except for the _Title_ and _Message_ fields.

### Style

The Style section enables you to customize the appearance of your In-App message elements, such as title color, background color, message color, button text color, and so on.

Customize the overall In-App message elements as per your brand style guidelines to make them visually appealing.

>
> We do not currently support Typeform because its rendering requires access to local storage which is a security risk. CleverTap SDK WebView does not allow access to local storage.
>
> The character limit for a message in English is 30 for the title and 128 for the message.  
> The character limit for a message in Chinese is 9 for the title and 38 for the message.
