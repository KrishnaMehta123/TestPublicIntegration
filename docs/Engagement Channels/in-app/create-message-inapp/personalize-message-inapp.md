# Overview

You can personalize the message for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information on user profile properties and events (dynamic replacements), refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events#event-properties).

# Inline Personalization

To invoke the personalization menu, type the _@_ or the \_{{}} \_symbol in the title or the text fields while creating a message.

You can also add dynamic replacements in the title and body. Notice a preview as displayed below.

In addition to title, body, you can also personalize many other things such as media URLs, deep links, or button text. An _@ _ icon in a box indicates that it can be personalized. 

# Recommendations

Click the ![Personlization](https://files.readme.io/b852e7f-Personalization_setting.png) icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

After you have uploaded a catalog, you can display personalized recommendations to your customers. For example, you can have a sliding carousel displayed to your customers based on their personal likes!  For more information on recommendations, refer to [Recommendations](doc:recommendations).
