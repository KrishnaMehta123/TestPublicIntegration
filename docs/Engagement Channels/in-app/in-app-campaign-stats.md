## Split of Clicks

You can track the distribution of clicks on each CTA that you include in your In-App campaign. For example, you want to send an In-App promotion for an upcoming movie on your video streaming app. You can create an In-App campaign, add CTAs for reviews, promotions, movie merchandise, and more, and then send it. We will record the clicks for each CTA in the In-App, and you can view them on the Campaign Stats page.
