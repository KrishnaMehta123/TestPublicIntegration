# Overview

This section covers various email tasks, including the integrations and inbox previews. No matter the type of customer emails, all businesses have the same goal of getting to the correct recipient's inbox. By setting up your email correctly, you ensure successful email deliverability.

# Email Integrations

Before creating email campaigns, you must integrate an email service provider with CleverTap. 

CleverTap supports integrations with popular email service providers. Select your email service provider from the following list:

- [Mandrill](doc:mandrill) 
- [Amazon Simple Email Service](doc:amazon-simple-email-service) 
- [Postmark](doc:postmark) 
- [SendGrid](doc:sendgrid) 
- [Gmail/Google Apps](doc:gmail-google-apps) 

For all other service providers, use [Generic SMTP](doc:generic-smtp).

# Set Up Provider

Once you have integrated an email service provider with CleverTap, you can set up your email service provider.

To add a provider, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to _Settings_ > _Engage_ > _Channels_ > _Email_.
2. Click **+ Provider** to add a provider.

3. Click **Save**.
4. (Optional) Click **Send Test Email** to check if the provider has been set up correctly and can send emails.

# Add Request ID

In PBS recurring and live campaigns, the same user may receive multiple emails in a single day, sometimes just seconds apart. As these messages are part of the same campaign, it can be difficult to differentiate when tracking delivery or engagement for each individual message. 

To solve this, you can enable the _Add request ID_ option while setting up the email provider. This unique system-generated identifier (`systemRequestId)` is assigned to every email sent using that provider configuration.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/8c40201c0deaf001517889d8fca6fb6044b4ecd24a19baa30b98aaa5fdf3f9e5-Add_Request_ID.png",
        "",
        "Add Request ID"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "35% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Add Request ID"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The `systemRequestId` helps you track each email using the `systemRequestId` to uniquely identify its progress across the following key events: Notification Sent, Notification Failed, Notification Delivered, Notification Viewed, and Notification Clicked. It is available as an event property for these events, helping you easily distinguish multiple messages sent as part of the same campaign and debug delivery issues more effectively.

While particularly useful for PBS recurring and live campaigns, this feature enhances message-level visibility for all campaign types.

Once enabled, CleverTap generates a unique, random request ID for every message sent using the selected provider. This setting applies to all campaigns that use that provider configuration. Messages sent before enabling this option remain unaffected.

You can disable this option anytime by editing the provider configuration.  Disabling it stops new messages from including the request ID; however, messages sent prior to the change retain their existing identifiers.
