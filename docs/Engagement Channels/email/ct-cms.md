# Overview

The CleverTap CMS allows you to create and maintain templates and files in a centralized repository. You can call these templates from the What section in your campaign creation flow. It also allows you to have specialized staff or an agency for template creation; they need not bother with other stages of campaign creation. You can control the access to templates and campaign creation via a [role based access](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/role-based-access-control).

# Templates

The *Templates* section stores the messaging templates for all your messaging channels. You can save and reuse templates from the templates section.. 

## Template View

Click the templates icon from the left navigation bar. The Templates are displayed in a card view. You can also toggle the view to list the templates, sort,  multi-select or delete templates. To create a new template, click the *Create Template* button.
