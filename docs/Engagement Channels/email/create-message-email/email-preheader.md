### Preheaders

Email preheader is the summary text that follows a subject line when the email is viewed in an inbox. If there is no Preheader text, the email inbox simply displays the beginning of your email text. It's a great opportunity to influence open rates positively.

    }
  ]

After you have created the message from the what section, click **Continue**. To display Preheader in your message, enter the Preheader text in the Preheader box.

      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Enter Preheader Text"
    }
  ]
}

It is recommended to limit the Preheader text to 100 characters. The final message will show the Preheader text along with the subject and the sender.
