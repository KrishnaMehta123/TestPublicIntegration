# Overview

[Gmail Promotional Annotations](https://developers.google.com/gmail/promotab/) enables you to highlight your email on the Gmail Promotions tab. Your email can include additional information, such as promotion codes, featured images, and deal expiration dates. This information is visible to your email subscribers before they open the email, thereby setting your message apart from other emails in the Promotions tab of the user's inbox. This is an excellent way to excite your users to open your email. CleverTap provides you with a no-code way to annotate your email messages.

# Annotate Emails with Deal Annotation

With Deal Annotation, the deals and offers stand out prominently in the Promotions tab of your Gmail inbox, capturing your audience's attention and increasing the likelihood of conversions.

# Annotate with Promotion Cards

Adding Promotion Cards to your annotations enhances the impact of email marketing campaigns by introducing image previews, either as a single card or a carousel of cards. This helps amplify engagement and drive higher conversion rates. Each card can be configured with its own image, title, description, and target URL.

> 📘 Supported Inboxes
>
> Single Image and Carousel annotations are supported only on the Gmail mobile apps (iOS and Android). They are not supported for:
>
> * Gmail on desktop
> * Users in the EU region (on any platform)

## Image Specification for Promotion Cards

To display promotion cards in an email, ensure that your images meet the following specifications based on the type of promotion card being used:

### For Carousel Layout

* Minimum Cards: You must add two or more promotion cards.
* Target URLs: Each image must have a unique target URL.
* Aspect Ratio Consistency: All images in the carousel must share the same aspect ratio.
* Supported Aspect Ratios: 1.91:1, 4:5, and 1:1

### For Single Image Layout

* Card Limit: Only one promotion card is allowed.
* Supported Aspect Ratio: 1.91:1

# Test Annotation

Create a unique Gmail testing account ending with [promotabtesting@gmail.com](mailto:promotabtesting@gmail.com) for your team. For example, _[mycompany.promotabtesting@gmail.com](mailto:mycompanypromotabtesting@gmail.com)_. This unique account will have a more aggressive email ranking and bundling to make testing easier and faster.

> 📘 Testing Promotion Cards
>
> For Promotion Cards to render, Google recommends a campaign with atleast 100 users.

# Troubleshooting

Before troubleshooting a problem, check your account-level settings in your Gmail app. Check that you have enabled the following settings to test the latest experiences in the _Gmail promotions_ tab. The following are the default settings:

* Images: Always show.
* Conversation view: On.
* Enable Bundling of Top Email: On.

The following sections include information about common issues encountered when attempting to test:

### Not seeing email bundles at all

To resolve this issue:

* Check that the device has the latest version of the Gmail app. Refresh your email by pulling down on the screen within the promotions tab.
* Try restarting your device.
* If the issue is still not resolved, try viewing the bundle on another device. For example, a tablet may have a different Gmail version and show the bundle differently.

> 📘 Email Held Up
>
> There is a chance your email could be in a holdback group. If none of the measures work, create a new account ending with _[promotabtesting@gmail.com](mailto:promotabtesting@gmail.com)_. For example, create _[mycompanypromotabtesting@gmail.com](mailto:mycompanypromotabtesting@gmail.com)_ and use that new account for testing.

### Email does not show up on the Promotions tab

To resolve this issue:

* Check if the marketing email was sent from the usual subdomain. Sending from less recognized subdomains can confuse the Gmail tab classifier and prevent an email from being placed on the Promotions tab.
* Check that your account has no email filters that send email to the primary tab because annotations are only visible on the Promotions tab.
* Send from different sender subdomains to ensure the email ends up on the correct tab. For more details about the Gmail classifier, refer to [Bulk Senders Guidelines](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126).
* If you are using a _[promotabtesting@gmail.com](mailto:promotabtesting@gmail.com)_ account, the first email does not appear on the Promotions tab. Drag the email onto the Promotions tab, and send an email from the same sender address, with a different subject line, to the testing account.

### Cannot see your brand's annotated email in a bundle

To resolve this issue:

* Check if the email is on the Gmail Promotions tab.
* Annotated emails are currently not available for Gmail for Business accounts. Ensure that you are testing on your personal Gmail address.
* Check that the email was not opened or sent on the previous day.
* An email does not populate in a bundle on another device after it is viewed on one device. You must send a new test email to preview.
* Create multiple testing accounts if you want to visualize on multiple devices. One of your team members might open the email, thus making it unavailable in the bundle for the rest of the team.
* Check that the annotation is not past the expiration date.
* Check that you are using the latest version of the Gmail app. Try viewing on another device. For example, a tablet may have a different version of the Gmail app and show email differently.
* Refresh the Gmail app by pulling down the Gmail Promotions tab screen.
* Check that you are not using sensitive categories in the Gmail Promotions tab. For example, adult content or debt collection.

### The email bundle is visible on one device but not on another

To resolve this issue:

* Check that you are viewing from the same email account.
* If the email is opened on one device first, the ranking of the bundle may change on another device.

# Best Practices

Gmail recommends the following to optimize your email annotations.

* **Leverage the Power of Visuals**  
  Gmail has observed improved results when emails feature captivating images that complement the message. Instead of text-only designs, focus on incorporating visually appealing elements. Avoid using images with text that gets cut off or reusing the same visuals across multiple campaigns.
* **Concise Offer Descriptions**  
  Gmail recommends concise and compelling offer descriptions. Avoid lengthy sentences or phrases, such as "Limited Time Offer: 50% Off All Accessories", or "Exclusive Deals on Summer Collection," as they might get clipped and compete with the subject line. Opt for clear, engaging language that encourages recipient engagement without repeating the subject line verbatim.

For more information about annotating your email messages effectively, refer to Google's [Best Practices](https://developers.google.com/gmail/promotab/best-practices).

# FAQs

### Can I see how many users received a product carousel?

Gmail decides when to show the product carousel, so not every person who gets the email will see it. Therefore, there's no definite way to know how many people received the product carousel.

### Why does my promotional message not display the product carousel in the user's inbox?

There are a few reasons why the product carousel might not appear in the Gmail Promotion Tab. Firstly, all the images in the promotion must be of good quality and have the correct aspect ratio. They should mostly be pictures of the product, without too much text or anything inappropriate.

Moreover, Gmail limits the number of product carousels it shows in the _Promotion_ tab. So, if a user receives a lot of emails with product carousels, Gmail might not show all of them.

### What image guidelines should I follow for Email Carousel Annotations?

It is recommended that high-quality, high-resolution product images be used. Try to avoid images with excessive text. The minimum image size is 256 pixels, and the maximum size is 4096 pixels. For the best results, use images with higher pixels.

### What is the minimum number of users required for rendering Promotion Cards?

Google recommends running the campaign with at least 100 users for optimal rendering and visibility.
