1. From the _What_ section of the Email campaigns, select the _Upload HTML_ option from the _Basic Templates_ tab. The Upload HTML Template popup opens.

   [block:image]{"images":[{"image":["https://files.readme.io/f38e62d4dd7f6d12206b0d967f56dfc12c3503bf0bc646c44942136ede6f0585-Upload_Template_HTML.png","","Upload HTML Template Popup"],"align":"center","sizing":"85% ","border":true,"caption":"Upload HTML Template Popup"}]}[/block]
2. Click **Upload File** or drag and drop to upload the required `.zip` file. You can download the sample zip file by clicking the _[Download sample file](https://d31lbcrrrnac8j.cloudfront.net/Sample-files/Sample-template.zip)_ link. The ZIP file must meet the following criteria:

   | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | File type               | Must be `.zip`                                                                                                                                                        |
   | HTML file               | Only one `.html` file allowed. It should be present inside the main folder and not in any subfolder. The CSS for the template must be present inside the`.html` file. |
   | Images                  | All image assets must be placed in a folder named **images**. Ensure all image references within the HTML file point to this folder correctly.                        |
   | Supported image formats | JPG, PNG, GIF                                                                                                                                                         |
   | File size               | Must be less than 5 MB                                                                                                                                                |

3. CleverTap parses the ZIP file:
   - Images are uploaded to the **CMS File Manager**.
   - The template is saved under **Saved Templates** and the **Templates** section of _Content Manager_.

The `.zip` file is validated during the upload process. For information about the feature, refer to [Upload Validations](doc:content-manager-templates-upload-html#upload-validations).

> 📘 Personalization for Uploaded Templates
> 
> If you upload an HTML file with characters like {{}} or @, CleverTap treats them as plain text. To use personalization, you can manually add them during email campaign setup after template upload. For detailed steps, refer to [Personalize Message](doc:personalize-message-upload-html-zip#:~:text=previous%20campaign%20interaction.-,When%20you,-upload%20an%20HTML).

# Saved Templates

The _Saved Templates_ tab in the email editor enables you to quickly reuse or access the existing templates and maintain consistency in branding across campaigns. Within this tab, you can preview the template before using it. The Saved templates are managed from the _Content Manager_ > _Templates_ > _Email_ page. Updates made in Content Manager are reflected in this tab.
