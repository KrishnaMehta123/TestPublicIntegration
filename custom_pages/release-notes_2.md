## Web Release

### Enhancement

**No-code Web Native Display Campaigns with Ready-to-use Templates (Enhancement)**\
We have released two new out-of-the-box templates—Banner and Banner with text. These templates will enable customers to utilize visually appealing banners with personalized text to create highly contextual content for their website visitors.

Customers will also be able to get started with Web Native campaigns with zero code efforts as CleverTap completely manages content delivery at the right moment and location on the customer’s website.

For more information, you can refer to the documentation below:

* [User documentation](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/web-native-display-create-message#web-native-display-templates)
* [Developer documentation](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/web-native-display)

## Workflows Release

### Enhancement

**Upscaled campaign reporting speed and the ability to handle large campaign volumes, with direct cloud ingestion of reports.**\
With the latest enhancement, customers can select up to 2000 campaigns, and in addition, the reporting has become lightning fast, taking a minimum of 10 mins. Our reporting time has improved by 800%, and the number of campaigns that can be selected has increased to 20x. This has reduced manual effort considerably and increased our customers' operational efficiency.

Also, now customers can directly export these reports to their partner cloud platforms like Amazon S3 or GCP and automate the process, which provides error-free ingestion of campaign reports.

## Automation and SDK Release

### Enhancement

**RenderMax - Groundbreaking Push Notification Render Rate Technology by CleverTap**\
RenderMax is our proprietary render rate technology that boosts push notification render rates up to 90%. This gives you a significant competitive advantage as you can engage users you could not before and elevate their ROI from push campaigns.

Most marketers just focus on push notification delivery rates, but a “delivered" notification that doesn't render on the user’s device is a wasted effort. RenderMax powers up the render rates of customers’ push notifications, amplifies the push notification reach, and maximizes user engagement. This is specifically true for devices that are in battery saver mode or cannot be reached due to inactivity.

For more details, refer to this [webpage](https://clevertap.com/rendermax/) and check the [documentation](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/rendermax).
