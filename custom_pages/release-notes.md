* Utilize Split Delivery to decide what percentage of the audience gets a message variant and compare campaign stats to identify the winning variant.
* Create Multi-variant Campaigns optimized for location, demographics, purchase trends, and more. Boost engagement and conversion with up to 50 variants of the same message based on a user property type.
